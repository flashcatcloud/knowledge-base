FlashDuty currently supports Single Sign-On (SSO) integration through SAML2.0, OIDC, CAS, and LDAP (private deployment only) protocols, enabling seamless integration with various applications and platforms. These features help you quickly implement identity information sharing with other platforms. Users only need to log in once to access multiple related applications and services without authenticating separately for each application, improving work efficiency, user experience, simplifying the login process, and enhancing security.

|BIND DN Password|Password for LDAP connection, will be encrypted in database|
|TLS|Skip Verify for TLS login|
|StartTLS|Whether to enable StartTLS|
|User DN|Defines the directory to start user search, e.g., ou=people,dc=flashduty,dc=com|
|Authentication Filter|Combined with Bind DN and password for user lookup, used to retrieve user DN information for LDAP authentication. Supports custom filter expressions, basic format: (&(mail=%s)). Note: Starting and ending parentheses are required|

:::tip

Field mapping must be consistent with identity provider configuration to avoid errors. Fill in values according to descriptions. Refer to [OpenLDAP Integration Guide](https://docs.flashcat.cloud/en/flashduty/openldap-integration-guide) for configuration. Contact FlashDuty customer service if you have questions.
