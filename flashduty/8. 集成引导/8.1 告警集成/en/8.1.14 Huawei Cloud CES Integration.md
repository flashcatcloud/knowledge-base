Sync Huawei Cloud CES alerts to Flashduty via webhook to achieve automated alert noise reduction.

## In Flashduty

You can obtain an integration push URL through either of these two methods:

### Using Dedicated Integration

Choose this method when you don't need to route alerts to different channels. It's simpler.

  1. Go to the Flashduty console, select **Channel**, and enter a channel's details page
  2. Select the **Integrations** tab, click **Add Integration** to enter the integration page
  3. Choose **Huawei Cloud CES** integration and click **Save** to generate a card
  4. Click the generated card to view the **push URL**, copy it for later use, and you're done
  
</details>

### Using Shared Integration

Choose this method when you need to route alerts to different channels based on the alert payload information.

<details>
  <summary>Expand</summary>
  
  1. Go to the Flashduty console, select **Integration Center=>Alerts** to enter the integration selection page
  2. Select **Huawei Cloud CES** integration:
        - **Integration Name**: Define a name for this integration
  3. Click **Save** and copy the newly generated **push URL** for later use
  4. Click **Create Route** to configure routing rules for the integration. You can match different alerts to different channels based on conditions, or set a default channel as a fallback, and adjust as needed later

Note: When creating a notification group, Huawei Cloud will send a request to Flashduty to verify the push URL. Check the notification group's object list - alerts will only be pushed normally when the notification object status is `Confirmed`

8. Go to `Alarm-Alarm Rules` page, edit existing alarm rules or create new ones to open the `Alarm Rule Details` page
9. Select `FlashDuty` as the notification group, check both `Alarm Triggered` and `Cleared` conditions. Click `OK` button to save changes
