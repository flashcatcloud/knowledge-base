You can obtain an integration push URL through either of these two methods:

### Using Shared Integration

  1. Go to the Flashduty console, select **Integration Center=>Alert Events** to enter the integration selection page

        - **Integration Name**: Define a name for this integration
  3. Click **Save** and copy the newly generated **push URL** for later use
