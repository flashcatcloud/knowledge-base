### Introduction
---

In today's rapidly evolving IT environment, organizations increasingly rely on comprehensive monitoring and incident management tools to ensure business continuity and service stability. However, as monitoring systems expand, the massive volume of alerts and incident notifications creates unprecedented challenges for IT teams. How to ensure each alert is captured, accurately delivered, and effectively responded to has become crucial for maintaining service quality.

Facing these challenges, the following situations indicate that organizations need to introduce or upgrade their On-Call tools:

- **Complete Tracking and Resolution**: Ensure every incident is tracked, handled, and resolved to prevent issues from escalating and avoid greater asset losses.
- **On-Call System Establishment**: Establish clear on-call rotation mechanisms, including primary and backup schedules, to reasonably distribute responsibilities and prevent alert fatigue.
- **Response Efficiency**: When SRE or development teams spend over 25% of their time on On-Call work, tools are needed to reduce noise and improve work efficiency.
- **Quantitative Metrics**: Establish quantitative metrics for incident response time and personnel workload to drive continuous improvement in service stability.

**"What key factors should we consider when purchasing On-Call services?"** This guide will provide comprehensive recommendations for On-Call tool procurement. We'll explore from three dimensions: **product**, **service**, and **pricing**, discussing the questions IT managers should ask when seeking efficient collaborative incident management solutions for their development and operations teams. Additionally, for each dimension, we'll provide a comparative analysis of mainstream On-Call providers like Flashduty and Pagerduty to help you make informed decisions.
