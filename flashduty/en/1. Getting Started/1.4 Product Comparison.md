### Introduction
---
Most organizations use multiple IT alerting and incident management tools, including monitoring, configuration, ticketing, and change management systems. While these systems can send notifications via email or SMS, handling massive monitoring alert events efficiently - ensuring none are missed and alerts are delivered to the right responders for quick response - is a crucial topic.

In this buyer's guide, we explore the questions that IT managers should ask when seeking efficient incident management solutions for their development and operations teams. We examine three dimensions: product, pricing, and service. For each dimension, we also highlight the differences between leading On-Call providers Flashduty and Pagerduty.
