## Basic workflow

### Create a channel

A channel is a container for related incidents. We typically create channels based on services owned, managed, or monitored by a team, such as an order system, recommendation service, MySQL component, Customer A, etc.

Go to the [Channels](https://console.flashcat.cloud/channel) page, click **Create Channel**, and enter an intuitive, concise name and description. Associate a management team with the channel to facilitate multi-person management in the future.

:::caution
Channels are managed using data permissions rather than role-based control.

**Only the account owner, channel creator, and management team members** have permission to modify channel configurations; others can only view them. This means anyone can create a channel, but they can only modify channels they participate in managing.

**Even if you are an account administrator, you cannot modify channel configurations that you do not participate in managing.**

### Integrate alerts

Channels can only store incidents; we need to introduce external integrations to receive alert events.

1. Go to the channel details page, click **Integrate Data**, select **Add an Integration**, choose the alert system used by your organization, and save.
2. The new integration will generate a unique push URL. Any alerts sent to this URL will directly enter the current channel. You need to complete the alert push configuration according to the documentation in the integration details.

   - Want to route alerts to different channels based on conditions? Go to **Integration Center - Alert Events**, add a shared integration, and then set routing rules based on conditions. This method is particularly suitable for integrations like Zabbix and Prometheus, which don't easily support webhook push management by strategy.

3. If this integration receives alert events, the integration card will display the **Latest Event Time**; otherwise, it will show **No Alert Events Received Yet**. You can troubleshoot whether the monitoring system has generated new alerts and whether the network is functioning properly.

:::tip
Flashduty has adapted to most commonly used monitoring systems, which you can use out of the box. If you have a custom alert system, use **Custom Event** or **Email Integration**. If you have requirements for other monitoring systems, please feel free to contact us.

### Configure notification methods

How will you be notified when an incident occurs?

1. Go to the channel details page, click **Escalation Rules**, and add or modify an escalation rule.
2. Go to Level 1 configuration, specify responders who will be notified when an incident is triggered. Specify the notification methods for the assigned responders.
   - Choose schedules, teams, or individuals as assignment targets. We recommend using schedules, so when an incident is triggered, the system only notifies the currently on-call responders.
   - Direct messages are one-to-one notifications such as SMS, voice calls, and email. IM applications like Feishu/Lark and Dingtalk also support one-to-one chat notifications.
   - Group chats push to IM message groups and notify assigned responders with @ mentions.
3. To ensure incidents are handled, you can add escalation levels. For example, if an incident hasn't been resolved after 30 minutes, escalate it to the Team Leader.

:::tip
How to set up incident notifications according to personal preferences?
Go to **Account Settings => Notification Settings** to set up how you want to be notified when assigned to incidents or on-call shifts. Note that these settings only take effect when directly assigned or when policy-based assignments are configured to follow personal preferences.

## Formal subscription

---

:::tip
Personnel with **Subscription Management** permissions can perform this operation.
:::

Newly registered organizations automatically receive a 2-week free trial. After testing, you can go to the **Billing Center** to upgrade to the Pro or Standard version.

- You can compare the feature differences between versions at the bottom of the page.
- Only members who handle incidents daily need licenses. Members who only passively receive alert notifications do not need licenses.
- If there are insufficient licenses, members without licenses cannot view or handle incidents. You can purchase additional licenses at any time through the console, effective immediately.
- Each license includes a certain free communication quota shared among all members.
- The system will remind the account owner daily via SMS 5 days before the subscription expires. Please renew in time to avoid affecting alert reception.
