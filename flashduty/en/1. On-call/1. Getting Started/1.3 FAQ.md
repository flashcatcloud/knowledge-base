<details>
  <summary>What is Flashduty On-call?</summary>
   Flashduty On-call is an all-in-one alert response platform. We provide IT professionals with On-call scheduling, alert noise reduction, escalation, and automation capabilities to accelerate incident response and minimize losses.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Is Flashduty On-call right for me?</summary>
  You should use Flashduty On-call if your organization or team has the following needs:
   
  - Need a centralized place to collect, manage, track, and analyze alerts from all sources within your company.
  - Need to classify alerts and notify key personnel through different channels dynamically, with automatic escalation processes to prevent unhandled alerts.
  - Spend most of your time handling alerts and need noise reduction solutions to address alert fatigue.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>How does Flashduty On-call pricing work?</summary>

Flashduty On-call's pricing model is based on the number of licenses purchased, where each license corresponds to one account member. For example, if you only purchase one license, only one member can use all features of Flashduty On-call. However, you can still invite more members to join, but only members with licenses can perform operational configurations on the platform, while other members **cannot use any platform features** (limited to receiving incident notifications only). The specific differences are as follows:

#### License Allocation Methods

- Administrators can actively allocate licenses to different members.
- When allocating licenses, you can set the license type.
- Fixed type: Valid for the entire purchase period, cannot be preempted, suitable for scenarios requiring participation in incident handling and business configuration.
- Temporary type: Automatically released at the end of each cycle, can be occupied through allocation or preemption when sufficient licenses are available.

#### Members Without Licenses

- Cannot use any features, including viewing incident lists/details, **can only passively receive alert messages**, such as receiving incident messages via email, SMS, phone calls, or IM group messages.
- When configuring assignment strategies, you can choose to notify members without licenses about incident messages.
- Members without licenses, even if they receive incident messages, cannot view, close, or perform other operations on them.
- Members without licenses share the tenant's email, SMS, and phone package quotas.
- Members without licenses will be prompted that they don't have permission when trying to view/handle operations after logging into the console.

  <summary>How does Flashduty On-call ensure I receive notifications?</summary>
   Flashduty On-call strives to ensure the availability of every notification channel.
    
  - Voice, SMS, and Email: We use highly available services from multiple cloud providers and can quickly switch to another if one experiences issues.
  - IM App Messages: If IM app direct messages fail to send, the system will fall back to SMS and email notifications.
  - Escalation Rule Settings: We recommend setting up loop notifications where the system will notify multiple times if an incident isn't acknowledged. Alternatively, set up escalation levels where the incident will be assigned to the next level if current responders don't handle it promptly.

<details>
  <summary>Why am I not receiving voice notifications?</summary>
   Voice calls are highly dependent on terminal signals and settings. If you consistently can't receive voice notifications, try these steps:

  1. If you're using a phone number registered outside mainland China, check our supported regions.  
  2. Check if your phone's blocklist or call history has blocked numbers around the time of the call, usually starting with 010xxx or 021xx. If found, remove them from the blocklist and whitelist them.
  3. If no blocklist is found, your phone number might have blocking services enabled: China Mobile users can check blocked fixed-line calls through the WeChat public account "China Mobile High-frequency Harassment Call Protection"; China Telecom users might experience call blocking when receiving SMS, check through "Tianyi Anti-harassment" public account; China Unicom users can check through "WO Assistant" public account or contact customer service.
  4. If you've participated in number portability, please check blocking settings with multiple carriers.
  5. Try restarting your phone, reinserting your SIM card, or testing the SIM card in another phone to rule out terminal or SIM card issues.

  If you still can't identify the cause, please contact us.

<details>
  <summary>Why am I not receiving email notifications?</summary>
   Try these steps:

  1. Check your email client's spam folder. If found there, please move the emails to inbox and mark as not spam.
  2. Check if your email client has auto-delete rules set up. If yes, please modify the rules.
  3. Contact your company's email administrator to check if emails are being blocked (Enterprise email services like Gmail have strict limitations and may block frequent emails). If blocked, please whitelist the email source.

  If you still can't identify the cause, please contact us.
