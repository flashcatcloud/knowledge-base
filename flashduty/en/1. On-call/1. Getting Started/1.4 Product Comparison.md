### Preface
---

In today's rapidly changing IT environment, organizations increasingly rely on a comprehensive set of monitoring and incident management tools to ensure business continuity and service stability. However, as monitoring systems expand, massive amounts of alerts and event notifications are generated, creating unprecedented challenges for IT teams. How to ensure each alert is promptly captured, accurately delivered, and effectively responded to has become crucial for maintaining service quality.

Facing this challenge, we find the following situations indicate an organization needs to introduce or upgrade its On-Call tools:

- **Complete tracking and resolution**: Ensure every incident can be tracked, handled, and resolved to prevent problems from escalating and avoid greater asset losses.
- **Establishing an On-Call mechanism**: Create a clear On-Call responder rotation system, including primary and backup shifts, to reasonably distribute responsibilities and prevent alert fatigue.
- **Improving response efficiency**: When SRE or development staff spend over 25% of their time on On-Call work, tools are needed to reduce noise and improve work efficiency.
- **Establishing quantitative metrics**: Create quantitative metrics for incident handling efficiency and personnel workload to drive continuous improvement in service stability through data.

**"What key factors should we consider when purchasing On-Call services?"** This guide provides comprehensive On-Call tool procurement recommendations. We'll explore the questions IT managers should ask when seeking efficient collaborative incident management solutions for their development and operations teams from three dimensions: **product**, **service**, and **price**. For each dimension, we also provide comparative analysis of mainstream domestic and international On-Call providers like Flashduty and Pagerduty to help you make informed decisions.
