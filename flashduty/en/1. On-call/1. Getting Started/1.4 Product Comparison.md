## 📋 Preface

In the rapidly evolving digital era, enterprise dependence on **monitoring and incident management tools** is growing day by day. These tools serve as crucial cornerstones for ensuring business continuity and service stability. However, as monitoring systems continue to expand in scale, **massive volumes of alerts and incident notifications** surge like a tide, bringing unprecedented operational challenges to IT teams.

> **Core question: How can we ensure that every alert is captured promptly, delivered accurately, and responded to efficiently?**

### 🚨 Are you facing these challenges?

When your organization encounters the following situations, it's time to consider introducing or upgrading On-call tools:

- **🔍 Comprehensive tracking and resolution**: Ensure every incident can be tracked, handled, and resolved to prevent problem escalation and avoid greater asset losses
- **👥 Establishing on-call mechanisms**: Build clear on-call personnel schedules, including primary and backup rotation systems, reasonably distribute responsibilities, and avoid alert information overload
- **⚡ Improving response efficiency**: When SRE or development personnel invest **more than 25%** in daily on-call work, tools are needed to reduce noise and improve work efficiency
- **📊 Establishing quantified metrics**: Build quantified metrics for incident handling timeliness and personnel workload to drive continuous improvement of service stability through data
