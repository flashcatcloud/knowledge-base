Investigate incidents, update key information, and synchronize with others.

## Change Information
---

After an incident is triggered, its manifestation may become clearer over time. You can modify key information such as the incident title to make it more accurate than the original alert message.

### Change Incident Title

1. Open the incident details in the console and click the edit button in the title section.
2. Enter the new title to complete.

The modified title will not change when new alerts are merged.

### Change Incident Severity

1. Open the incident details in the console and select the new severity level.
2. Click outside to complete.

:::highlight orange ðŸ’¡ 
The modified severity will not change when new alerts are merged.

### Update Incident Description and Impact

1. Open the incident details in the console and click to enter new information in the description and impact sections.
2. The system will save automatically.

**You can use Markdown syntax to update the incident description and impact, or directly copy and paste images!**

## Acknowledge Incidents
---

There are three ways to acknowledge a newly triggered incident.

### Acknowledge via Console

- **Single Acknowledge**: Open incident details in the console, click the **acknowledge** button to complete.
- **Batch Operation**: In the incident list, select multiple pending incidents and click the **acknowledge** button to complete batch acknowledgment.

### Acknowledge via IM Applications

- **App Messages**: The main card of application messages provides an **acknowledge** button. Click the card to complete acknowledgment. If clicking has no effect, you may not have completed account association in the application or there might be other issues. Please refer to [Feishu/Lark Integration Guide](http://docs.flashcat.cloud/en/flashduty/lark-integration-guide?nav=01JCQ7A4N4WRWNXW8EWEHXCMF5).
- **Bot Messages**: Most bot channels push messages in Markdown format. You can modify the notification template to add an **acknowledge** link for console redirection. Please refer to the default template for details.

### Acknowledge via Voice Call

For voice alerts pushed by Flashduty, after the voice broadcast ends, you'll be prompted to **Press 1 to acknowledge**. Press 1, and the system will complete the incident acknowledgment under your identity.

### Unacknowledge Incidents

Once someone acknowledges an incident, its status changes from "pending" to "processing". Additional acknowledgments won't change the incident status.

After acknowledging an incident, you can choose to **unacknowledge** it, which is useful in cases of mistaken acknowledgment. When all acknowledgers unacknowledge, the incident will return to **pending** status.

### Processing Progress and MTTA

You can view each person's assignment time and acknowledgment time in the console. We calculate incident MTTA according to these rules:

- MTTA (Mean Time to Acknowledge) is defined as the average acknowledgment duration, calculated as the difference between acknowledgment time and trigger time.
- For the same incident, each person can have different assignment and acknowledgment times. Therefore, MTTA calculations may differ for each person.
- For an incident's overall MTTA, we only calculate the time difference between the trigger time and the first acknowledgment.

## Snooze Incidents
---

After acknowledging an incident, responders may need time to investigate and handle it. The **Snooze** operation can temporarily pause the incident from escalating according to the expected escalation rule. After acknowledging an incident, you can set a snooze duration, such as 2 hours, 4 hours, or a custom time within 24 hours.

:::highlight orange ðŸ’¡ 
If you've snoozed an incident and the snooze time expires without completing the incident handling, the system will automatically return the incident to **pending** status and reinitiate assignment notifications.
:::

### Snooze via Console

Open incident details in the console, click the **Snooze** button, select duration to complete.

### Snooze via IM Applications

Click the **Snooze** button on the incident message card, select duration to complete.

## Close Incidents
---

You have multiple ways to close an incident.

### Close via Console

- **Single Close**: Open incident details in the console, click the **close** button to complete.
- **Batch Operation**: In the incident list, select multiple pending incidents and click the **close** button to complete batch closure.

### Close via IM Applications

The main card of application messages provides a **close** button. Click the card to complete closure. If clicking has no effect, you may not have completed account association in the application or there might be other issues. Please refer to [Feishu/Lark Integration Guide](http://docs.flashcat.cloud/en/flashduty/lark-integration-guide?nav=01JCQ7A4N4WRWNXW8EWEHXCMF5).

### Reopen Incidents

Manually closing an incident changes its status to **closed**. You can click the **close** button in any status. After manual closure, associated alerts will stop merging new events. If the alert hasn't recovered in the original alert system, new notification events might be generated, triggering new alerts and incidents in Flashduty.

You can reopen an incident after mistaken closure. After reopening, the incident will return to **pending** status and reinitiate assignment and notifications.

## Merge Processing
---

You can manually merge between incidents or between incidents and alerts. Merging similar alerts and incidents together consolidates information into a single incident, accelerating the handling process.

**Merge Between Incidents**: You can select multiple incidents in the console to merge into a target incident. You can also select other target incidents for merging from an incident's details.

**Merge Alerts into Incidents**: Alerts may merge into certain incidents due to grouping policies, but you can adjust incident-alert associations. You can go to alert details and click the **merge** button to migrate alerts to target incidents.

**The essence of merging is: changing alert-incident associations. If all alerts in an incident are merged into other incidents, this incident will close directly, and you'll only need to handle the target incident.**

The timeline will fully record your modification process.

## FAQ
---

<details>
  <summary>Why does the system still trigger similar incidents after I snoozed one?</summary>
  
  You might have confused the **Snooze function** with the **silence function**, but they are quite different.
  
  - Silence function requires you to fill in matching policies. When newly triggered incidents match the silence policy, they won't receive notifications. Silence policies can affect notifications of new incidents.
  - Snooze function doesn't require any policies. It only gives you time to handle the incident after acknowledgment, preventing escalation to the next level responder during processing.

  If you need to suppress an alert policy, use **silence** instead of **Snooze**.
