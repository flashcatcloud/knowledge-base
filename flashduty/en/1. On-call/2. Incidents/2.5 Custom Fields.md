## Use Cases
---

Flashduty supports integration with most common alert systems, and we display most of the pushed content information in Labels. However, our users may still have extension or customization needs, such as manually marking whether an incident is a false alarm. Therefore, we provide the **Custom Fields** feature to further enrich incident descriptions.

With custom fields, you can add custom metadata, record specific incident-related information, and transmit and use this information during incident handling. Here are common use cases for custom fields:

- **Flexible Definition**: You can create multiple custom fields and define their names, types, options, and default values according to your needs. Common custom field types include text, dropdown lists, checkboxes, etc.

- **Information Association**: Through custom fields, you can associate incidents with other related data. For example, you can add custom fields to identify affected systems, geographic locations, associated customers, or whether it's a false alarm.

- **Filtering and Classification**: The incident list supports filtering and classification views by custom fields. You can create frequently used filters based on custom field values for better organization and handling of incidents.

### Creating Fields

An account can create up to 15 custom fields.
:::

1. Go to console **Incident Management=>Custom Fields**
2. Click **Create Custom Field**
3. Enter the following information

    - **Field Name**: Identifies the field in the API, cannot be modified after creation.
    - **Display Name**: The field shown on the incident details page, can be modified after creation.
    - **Field Description**: Helps incident responders understand and use the field.

4. Select the field type and add options and default values as needed. Field types include:

    - **Text**: Plain text input box, maximum 500 characters.
    - **Single Select**: Single-select dropdown, allows up to ten options, each option cannot exceed 200 characters.

If a field has a default value set, the system will automatically write to that field and assign the default value when an incident is generated. Note that fields only affect new incidents and have no impact on existing incidents.
:::

### Updating Fields

Only the following content can be updated:

1. Display Name
2. Field Description
3. Field Options (only for single and multi-select types)
4. Default Value

:::highlight orange ðŸ’¡ 
Field updates only affect new incidents and have no impact on existing incidents.
:::

### Deleting Fields

You can initiate deletion operations in the console at any time. However, please note that deletion is a time-consuming operation. When deleting a field, the system will scan historical incidents and asynchronously update to remove the association between the field and incidents. You cannot create a field with the same name until the deletion is complete.

## FAQ

<details>
  <summary>Why can't I search incidents by the fields I created?</summary>
  
  Please check if the field type you want to search is a **Text** type. To ensure system stability, the system currently does not support searching text type fields. We appreciate your understanding.
