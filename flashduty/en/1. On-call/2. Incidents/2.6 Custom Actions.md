## Use Cases
---

A custom action is essentially a webhook call. You can add custom actions for incidents in different channels and manually trigger these actions from the incident details to achieve quick troubleshooting or information synchronization.

Common use cases for custom actions:
1. **Server Restart**: When server memory or CPU is maxed out, trigger a restart script to quickly complete server reboot.
2. **Information Enrichment**: When an incident occurs, callback to your service to retrieve Tracing, Logging, topology, and other information based on alert details. Actively call FlashDuty Open API to update incident information, such as adding labels or setting custom fields to assist troubleshooting.
3. **Rollback Changes**: When an incident occurs and is confirmed to be caused by a change, directly trigger a callback to your deployment platform to initiate the rollback process, accelerating incident recovery.
4. **Update Status Page**: When confirming that an incident affects online services, trigger external Status Page updates to promptly notify your customers and dependencies.

## Configure Custom Actions
---

1. Log in to the console and go to **Integration Center=>Webhook**
2. Click to add a **Custom Action** integration
3. Configure the following information:
    - **Action Name**, which will appear as a button in the incident details.
    - **Channel**, multiple can be configured, but each channel can have up to three custom actions.
    - **Endpoint**, the HTTP(s) address that will be called when the custom action button is clicked.
    - **Custom Headers**, custom message headers to be carried when requesting the Endpoint.
4. Save to complete

After creation, you can find the action button under [Incident Details-More Actions] in the corresponding channel. Clicking the button will show the operation result. If successful, the system will record the operation.
