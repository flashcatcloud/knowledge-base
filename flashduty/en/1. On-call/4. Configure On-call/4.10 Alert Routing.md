## Configuration Steps
---
Configuration path: **Integration Center => Alert Events => Select Integration Details => Routes => Add Route**

**1. Add Routes:** Multiple routes can be added without current limitations, but it's recommended to keep them simple as too many rules may reduce readability.
**2. Adjust Order:** When there are two or more routing rules, you can adjust their execution order using up and down arrows.
**3. Routing Rules:** Supports multiple conditions and rules with logical operations (including match or non-match operations). Various matching modes are available, such as exact match, wildcard, and regex. You can visit [Configure Filter Conditions](https://docs.flashcat.cloud/en/flashduty/how-to-filter) to learn how to set up conditions.
**4. Flow Control:** When there are multiple routing rules, you can choose to **stop or continue** matching subsequent rules. The default is **continue matching**, meaning lower routes remain effective. Selecting **stop** will prevent lower rules from taking effect.
**5. Preview Rules:** After configuration, you can review the rule expressions.
**6. Insert Routes:** With multiple routing rules, you can insert new routes before or after existing ones, eliminating the need to adjust order manually.
**7. Default Route:** Shared integrations require at least one routing rule to receive alerts. A default routing rule is provided to distribute alerts to corresponding channels when no rules are configured or matched.
**8. Target Channels:** You can select multiple channels to receive matched alerts.
**9. Edit History:** Supports viewing historical configurations and quickly restoring to a specific version (the configuration button only appears when routes have been edited multiple times).
