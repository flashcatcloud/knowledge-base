## Core Notification Channel Configuration

### Flashduty App

The Flashduty App is the most efficient mobile tool for on-call engineers. It allows you to manage the entire incident handling process from anywhere, just as you would at your computer.

![2025-09-18-12-09-41](https://docs-cdn.flashcat.cloud/images/png/63bbac8f1f3de4dee54b8605e414c163.png)

#### Core Features

- **Guaranteed Delivery of Critical Notifications**
  - **iOS Critical Alerts**: Leverages Apple's official `Critical Alerts` protocol to bypass system mute and Do Not Disturb settings, ensuring 100% delivery of high-priority alerts.
  - **Android System-Level Channels**: Supports system-level push channels from major Android manufacturers to ensure timely notifications even when the app is in the background or closed.
- **Efficient Mobile Handling**
  - Perform all core actions on your phone, including searching, viewing details, acknowledging, closing, escalating, and manually creating incidents. Deep optimization for mobile interaction improves the response speed of key operations by 40%.
- **Smart Voice Notification Identification**
  - The app can automatically sync Flashduty's voice notification numbers to your phone's contacts, creating a whitelist to prevent them from being mistakenly blocked by carriers or security software.

#### How to Set Up and Use

1. **Download and Install**
  - Search for "Flashduty" on the `App Store` or major Android app stores, or scan the QR code in your profile on the console to download.
2. **Log In and Link Your Device**
  - Open the app and log in with your Flashduty account, or scan the QR code on the console to log in.
  - After logging in, your device will be automatically linked to your account. You can view linked devices under **Profile** → **Flashduty APP**.
3. **Enable Critical Permissions (Important)**
  - **For iOS users**: Go to **System Settings** → **Notifications** → **Flashduty** and enable the **Critical Alerts** toggle.
  - **For all users**: It is recommended to enable the **Sync Contacts** permission in the app's **Settings** → **Voice Notifications**.

#### FAQ

1. **Why am I not receiving app push notifications?**
  - Please check if notification permissions for the Flashduty app are enabled in your phone's system settings.
  - Ensure that app push is configured as a notification channel in your **escalation rule**. If it's set to `Follow personal preferences`, check if the Flashduty app is enabled in your personal notification settings.
2. **What should I do if the app fails to sync contacts?**
  - Please check your current network connection.
  - Make sure you are using the latest version of the app.

### Voice, SMS, & Email

#### Use Cases

- **Incident Escalation**: Use voice calls as the final step in an escalation rule for forced delivery.
- **IM Failure Fallback**: If an IM message fails to send, the system will automatically send a reminder via SMS or email.
- **Offline Coverage**: Reach team members in areas with poor network connectivity or those who do not use smartphones.

#### How to Set Up and Use

1. **Bind Contact Information**
  - Go to **Profile** → **Basic Info** to bind and verify your phone number and email address. This is required to receive notifications.
2. **Use in Escalation Rules**
  - Add voice, SMS, or email as notification methods in your **escalation rule**.

> **Tip**: Voice notifications support interactive acknowledgment. After answering the call and listening to the incident report, press `1` to quickly acknowledge the incident without logging into the system.

#### FAQ

1. **Why can't I receive voice notifications?**
  - **Check phone block settings**: Review your phone's blocklist or spam filter records. Flashduty uses fixed numbers for voice calls. You can download the Flashduty app to sync a contact whitelist.
  - **Check carrier services**: Some users may have carrier-level services that block high-frequency spam calls. You can check and configure these services through your carrier's official channels (e.g., the "China Mobile High-Frequency Spam Call Protection" public account).
  - **Ported numbers**: If you have ported your number from another carrier, please check the blocking policies of all relevant carriers.
2. **Why are emails going to my spam folder?**
  - Please check your "Spam" or "Junk" folder. If you find emails from Flashduty, mark them as "Not Spam."
  - We recommend adding Flashduty's sending domain or address to your email whitelist.
  - In some cases, you may need to contact your company's email administrator to whitelist Flashduty's email address (`no-reply@notice.flashcat.cloud`) at the domain level.

## Instant Messaging (IM) Integrations

By integrating Flashduty with your team's daily IM tools (such as Feishu/Lark and DingTalk), you can receive and handle incidents in your familiar collaboration environment, significantly improving on-call efficiency.

### App Integration (Recommended)

## General Configuration and FAQ

### How to Customize Notification Content?

Flashduty allows you to create custom notification messages for different channels.

- **Configuration Path**: **Console** → **Templates**
- Here, you can select different notification types (e.g., incident triggered, acknowledged, closed) and edit the message format for each channel (e.g., SMS, Feishu/Lark bot). Templates support variables to dynamically display incident information.

For more details, please refer to the [Configure Notification Templates](https://docs.flashcat.cloud/en/flashduty/template-settings?nav=01JCQ7A4N4WRWNXW8EWEHXCMF5) documentation.

### How to Configure Different Notification Policies for Different Incident Levels?

You can design fine-grained notification workflows based on alert severity, source, labels, and any other dimension. This is primarily achieved through **Routing Rules** and **Escalation Rules**.

- **Routing Rules**: **Integrations** → **(Select an integration)** → **Routing Rules**. These determine which alerts are routed to which channels.
- **Escalation Rules**: **Channels** → **Escalation Rules**. These determine who should be notified, through which channels, and how to escalate if there is no response.

For example, you can configure a rule where `P1` incidents first notify the primary on-call responder via the **Flashduty App** and **Feishu/Lark App**. If no one acknowledges it within 5 minutes, a **voice call** is made to their supervisor.
