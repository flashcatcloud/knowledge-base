The Alert  Pipeline is used to manage and optimize triggered alert events, including updating alert titles, modifying alert descriptions, adjusting alert severity, and performing alert filtering or inhibition operations. Through proper configuration of alert  rules, you can improve alert readability, reduce alert noise, and enhance problem identification efficiency.

## Alert  Configuration
---

Configuration path: **Integration Center** => **Integration Details** => **Alert **

- When configuring alert , you can add multiple  actions. Flashduty will execute these actions sequentially according to the configured order.
- When configuring  actions, you can set alert  conditions. The actions will only be executed when alerts meet these conditions.
- The result of each  action can serve as input conditions for the next  action.

## Alert  Conditions
---

- When condition restrictions are enabled, you can choose to pre-process alerts that meet specific conditions, enabling more precise and flexible alert  actions.
- Alert  conditions support various options, including alert attributes such as title, description, severity, and alert labels. Value matching patterns support fuzzy matching, exact matching, regular expression matching, numerical matching, and CIDR matching. For details, refer to the [Configure Filter Conditions](https://docs.flashcat.cloud/en/flashduty/how-to-filter) documentation.

## Action  Types
---

### Update Alert Title

Modify the original alert title to new content. The new content can be fixed text, referenced alert labels and attributes, or a combination of both. For reference syntax, see the [Referencing Variables](https://docs.flashcat.cloud/en/flashduty/customize-incident-attrs) documentation. Title length must **not exceed 512** characters; excess content will be truncated.

### Update Alert Description
Modify the original alert description to new content. The new content can be fixed text, referenced alert labels and attributes, or a combination of both. For reference syntax, see [Referencing Variables](https://docs.flashcat.cloud/en/flashduty/customize-incident-attrs) documentation. Description length must **not exceed 2048** characters; excess content will be truncated.

### Update Severity
Alert severity is typically determined by system preset mapping rules. You can now customize severity levels through the update severity  action to more accurately define alert importance.

### Alert Drop
Alert drop functionality is identical to the **drop rule** in channels, with the only difference being that the former operates at the integration level while the latter at the channel level. Alert drop  action can directly discard unnecessary alerts at the integration level, reducing alert  load.

### Alert Inhibition
Alert inhibition offers two  methods:
- Integration-level alert inhibition discards alerts meeting inhibition conditions immediately upon entering the system.
- Channel-level alert inhibition processes alerts after they've been routed to channels, where you can flexibly choose to either discard these alerts or retain them for future reference.

This layered design meets alert management needs in different scenarios, both reducing unnecessary alert noise and ensuring critical alerts are effectively processed.

## Use Cases and Examples
---

For the following examples, we'll reference a test alert triggered by Nightingale, as shown below:

```json
{
	"incident_status": "Info",
	"incident_severity": "Info",
	"title": "hm-test-alert-rule-name / Cluster-01 - demo-01",
	"description": "hm-test-alert-rule-name trigger value: 29.14912",
	"labels": {
		"__name__": "cpu_usage_idle",
		"cate": "prometheus",
		"check": "hm-test-alert-rule-name",
		"cluster": "Cluster-01",
		"cpu": "cpu-total",
		"datasource_id": "4",
		"detail_url": "https://demo.flashcat.cloud/alert-his-events/4974655",
		"group_id": "1",
		"group_name": "FlashcatOps",
		"ident": "demo-01",
		"metric": "cpu_usage_idle",
		"prom_eval_interval": "10",
		"prom_ql": "cpu_usage_idle{ident=\"demo-01\"} \u003c 100",
		"region": "bj",
		"resource": "demo-01",
		"role": "master",
		"rule_id": "1041",
		"rule_prod": "metric",
		"trigger_value": "29.27852"
	}
}
```

### Case 1: Modify Alert Title

When the original alert title cannot be modified, it defaults to: \$check::\$cluster::\$ident. You can now redefine the alert title using the update alert title  action, for example, using: Labels.ident, Labels.cpu, Labels.trigger_value, or other alert attributes. Reference syntax examples:

- **Fixed Title Format**

- **Custom Delimiter + Content Combination**

<img src="https://download.flashcat.cloud/flashduty/doc/en/fd/pipeline-4.png" width="800" />

- **Reference Labels + Reference Alert Attributes**

### Case 2: Update Alert Description
Alert description typically combines the alert rule name and trigger value. You can now modify the alert description content using the update alert description  action. Reference syntax examples:

- **Custom Content**

<img src="https://download.flashcat.cloud/flashduty/doc/en/fd/pipeline-6.png" width="800" >

### Case 3: Update Alert Severity

By default, Nightingale's three-level alerts correspond to Flashduty's Info level. You can now adjust alert severity levels using the update severity  action for more flexible definition of alert importance.

- **Change Alert Severity to Critical for Host demo-01**
