## Configure Alert Grouping
---

Go to `Channel Details` - `Noise reduction` to set up **alert grouping** strategies. When creating a new channel, alert grouping is disabled by default. We recommend enabling it manually and configuring grouping strategies as needed.

:::tip
When alert grouping is disabled, each alert will create a separate incident with identical basic information.
:::

### General Configuration

- **Grouping Window:** You can choose to only group alerts that occur close together (stronger correlation). Alerts outside the time window will trigger new incidents. Note that this is a sliding window that extends as new alerts are merged.
- **Storm Warning:** After an incident is triggered, the system will immediately assign and notify (assuming you haven't set notification delays). Subsequently merged alerts won't trigger new notifications, which could prevent you from detecting alert storms. Therefore, we provide this threshold - when the number of merged alerts reaches the threshold, the system will trigger a storm warning to remind you to handle it urgently.
- **Strict Grouping:** When enabled, grouping conditions where both alert and incident values are empty will be treated as different items; when disabled, they will be treated as equal items (not supported in intelligent grouping).
- **Preview:** You can use the preview function to fetch recent events and render noise reduction results in real-time to evaluate effectiveness.

### Alert Grouping Mode

Flashduty provides two alert grouping modes, **Intelligent Grouping** and **Rule-based Grouping**. Intelligent Grouping uses machine learning algorithms to deeply analyze the semantic content of incident information, identifying and merging similar events. This approach eliminates the need for manual configuration of grouping rules, making it suitable for scenarios with low aggregation requirements. In contrast, Rule-based Grouping provides a more direct and customizable approach, allowing users to configure specific grouping rules based on their business logic and requirements. Users can define which events should be grouped together, ensuring event management aligns with organizational requirements. This approach provides complete control over complex event streams, allowing them to be effectively managed and prioritized according to predefined standards.

#### Intelligent Grouping

- **Intelligent Grouping:** When a newly triggered alert is highly similar to an active incident's content, the alert will be merged into the incident.

### Rule-based Grouping

- **Unified Control:** All new alerts in the channel use the same dimensions for grouping. Supports selecting multiple attributes and labels, with conditions matching only when all attributes and labels are identical.

- **Fine-grained Control:** New alerts are grouped by matching conditions dimensions. If no match is found, default dimensions are used. If no default dimensions are set, no grouping occurs.

## Grouping Example
---

With the channel set to group by **alert check item**, the system receives 5 alert notifications that trigger alerts and incidents in sequence:

```
Incident: cpu idle < 20% / es.nj.03, Critical

  - Alert cpu idle < 20% / es.nj.03:
      - Event 1: es.nj.03, cpu.idle = 10%, Critical
      - Event 2: es.nj.03, cpu.idle = 18%, Warning
      - Event 4: es.nj.03, cpu.idle = 10%, Ok

  - Alert cpu idle < 20% / es.nj.01:
      - Event 3: es.nj.01, cpu.idle = 15%, Warning
  
  - Alert cpu idle < 20% / es.nj.02:
      - Event 5: es.nj.02, cpu.idle = 19%, Warning
```

Through the console's incident details page, we can see the final [Incident-Alert-Event] relationships:
- Click the alert title to view associated alert details, including the alert timeline and related events
- Click an event point to view specific event report content, including labels and descriptions

## Flapping Detection
---

The system will only mark an incident as flapping when the same incident frequently triggers and recovers, and flapping detection is enabled. A "same incident" refers to incidents with the same Alert Key. The calculation method for Alert Key may vary across different alert sources, typically using the alert ID pushed from upstream systems as the unique identifier for the incident.

- **Disabled by default:** No flapping detection is performed.
- **Remind Only:** Incidents entering flapping state will continue to be notified according to the assignment strategy, serving as a reminder only.
- **Remind and Suppress:** Incidents entering flapping state will not trigger notifications after the initial alert.

## FAQ
---

<details>
  <summary>Does the incident title change when alerts are merged?</summary>
  No, by default, the incident title remains identical to the first alert that triggered it. You can manually modify the incident title at any time, and it won't change as new alerts are merged.
</details>
<details>
  <summary>Do incident labels change when alerts are merged?</summary>
  
  - Manually created alerts: No, their label list will always remain empty
  - Automatically triggered alerts: Possibly. The incident's labels will remain consistent with the first alert that triggered it. If the alert's labels change, the incident's labels will sync accordingly.
</details>
<details>
  <summary>Do alert labels change when events are merged?</summary>
  Yes, alert labels always stay consistent with newly merged events. For example, if you receive a "CPU idle too low" alert at 10:00 with a trigger value of 10%, this trigger value label may change dynamically as more events are merged. However, if a new recovery event is received, the alert will maintain existing labels and only add previously non-existent labels. Our principle is to keep alert labels as close as possible to their trigger state.
</details>
<details>
  <summary>Is there a limit to the number of alerts that can be merged into an incident?</summary>
  Yes, we limit each incident to grouping a maximum of 1000 alerts, primarily to reduce console page rendering time. However, as Flashduty is a high-performance event processing system with extensive concurrent logic, it's normal to occasionally see incidents with more than 1000 grouped alerts.
</details>
<details>
  <summary>Is there a limit to the number of events that can be merged into an alert?</summary>
  No, but an alert's event grouping window is maximum 24 hours. This means if an alert hasn't recovered after 24 hours, no new events will be merged. If Flashduty receives new events, it will generate new alerts.
</details>
<details>
  <summary>Why doesn't the number of events I pushed match the number of events associated with the alert?</summary>
  Event-to-alert merging is also a noise reduction process. If Flashduty determines that a newly reported event doesn't significantly change the alert (e.g., no changes in status, severity, description, etc.), Flashduty will discard the new event and use its labels to override existing ones.
