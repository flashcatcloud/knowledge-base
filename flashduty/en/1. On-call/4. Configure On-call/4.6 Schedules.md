## Schedule
---
1. You can view a summary of all your schedules on the schedule management page.
2. Core members can view all schedules or only the schedules they manage.
3. Before setting up schedule rules, you need to create a schedule, which can be assigned to a team for maintenance and planning by team members.
4. When creating a schedule, you can flexibly configure notification methods for shift rotations:    
   - Advance notification：Notify the next On-call person N minutes before shift handover.
   - Scheduled notification：Notify the next On-call person at a fixed time every day.
   - Notification channels: Direct message (one-on-one notifications via SMS, voice call, email, etc.), Group chat (push to IM group chat with @ mentions for responders).

### Schedule Rule Components

- The final schedule rules are formed by combining regular schedule rules and temporary schedule changes.
- Schedule rules can be viewed from both timeline and calendar perspectives to see the final On-call arrangement.

### Edit Rules
#### 1. Creation

- A single schedule can have multiple schedule rules to meet different business requirements.
- When scheduling, carefully consider On-call times and rotation cycles to avoid coverage gaps.

#### 2. Modification

- Hover over a rule and click to open the rule configuration dialog.
- Changes to existing schedule rules, including adding/removing On-call personnel or modifying schedule times, won't affect historical data.
- Rule changes take effect immediately after saving.

#### 3. Delete

- Rule deletion cannot be undone, please proceed with caution.
- Deletion takes effect immediately, please confirm if any business operations are still using the rule before deletion.

#### 4. Temporary Schedule Changes
- Temporary schedule changes are mainly used for pre-planned schedules, such as when an On-call person needs a replacement due to unexpected circumstances or leave.
- Before making schedule changes, thoroughly communicate the required On-call times with the replacement person. While shift rotations include notifications, immediate adjustments take effect instantly without system notifications.
