## Use Cases
---
- When assigning incidents, you can use calendar patterns to assign based on working days or rest days.
- When you need to silence alerts during specific time periods, you can use calendar patterns for periodic silencing.

## Create Calendar
---
**Go to Console => Incident Management => Service Calendar => Add Calendar to create**.
- It's recommended to name calendars based on business dimensions, such as Payment Processing System.
- The calendar description should outline business characteristics and logic for quick team understanding.
- Team members added to the calendar management will have full permissions for that calendar.
- Newly created calendars default to all working days. It's recommended to directly associate with national holidays to automatically obtain holiday arrangements, saving manual marking steps. Manual adjustments are still supported after association.

## FAQ

<details>
<summary>What's the difference between calendar and schedule labels?</summary>
The main difference between service calendars and schedules lies in their positioning and use cases. Schedules are used for receiving and are incident reception objects, responsible for receiving and handling incidents assigned to that schedule. Service calendars are used during assignment, determining which time periods incidents should be assigned, functioning at a higher level than receivers. Service calendars are commonly used in the securities industry, for example, in businesses that only trade on working days.
