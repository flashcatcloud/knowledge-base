The insights dashboard enables business data analysis across multiple dimensions including channel, team, and responders. It supports data download and export capabilities to drive business growth through data-driven decisions.

### Key Features
- **Multi-dimensional Analysis**: View operational efficiency from global and temporal perspectives, extending to team, channel, and personal dimensions for comprehensive understanding.
- **Flexible Drill-down**: Support drilling down from global view to sub-dimensions for in-depth metric analysis and quick problem identification.
- **Data Comparison**: Compare data across different dimensions to identify team differences and areas for improvement.
- **Data Export**: Export data to CSV format for further analysis and report generation.

### Filter Conditions
When customizing filter conditions, the system remembers selected conditions even after page refresh, but one user's selections don't affect others
- **Team**: Select team names to query, supports multiple selection, dashboard data updates based on selected teams.
- **Channel**: Select channel names to query, supports multiple selection, dashboard data updates based on selected channels.
- **Severity**: Select severity levels to query, supports multiple selection, dashboard data updates based on selected severity levels.
- **Time Range**: Select query time range, supports dimensions like this week, last two weeks, this month, last month, and custom time periods, with a maximum query range of 180 days.
- **Data Interval**: Supports day, week, and month dimensions for queries, defaults to hourly queries, but daily view is unavailable when query range exceeds 31 days.
- **Sorting**: Team, channel, and personal dashboard dimensions support ascending and descending order, defaulting to TOP 10 data display, with more available in expanded view.

### Split hours
For 24/7 On-call support, we divide time into three phases to distinguish impact differences on team members
- **Work**: Monday to Friday 8am-7pm, team's normal working hours.
- **Rest**: Monday to Friday 7pm-11pm, non-working days 8am-11pm, team members' rest or leisure time.
- **Sleep**: Daily 11pm-8am, disruptions during this period severely impact team members' rest quality.

### Metric Definitions
Grouped incidents don't trigger notifications as they're typically ignorable, so all metrics exclude grouped incidents
- **Incidents**: Number of incidents generated, excluding grouped incidents.
- **MTTA**: Mean Time To Acknowledge (time between incident trigger and acknowledgment), excludes incidents without acknowledgment.
- **MTTR**: Mean Time To Resolve (time between incident trigger and closure), excluded from personal metrics.
- **Ack ratio**: Calculated as: Ack ratio = (Acknowledged Incidents / Total Incidents) * 100%.
- **Response effort**: Total time responders spend handling incidents, calculated as sum of time between acknowledgment and resolution.
- **Interruptions**: Counts notifications via SMS, voice, and APP push only. Multiple channels to one responder count as one interruption, notifications within 1 minute of previous don't count.

:::tip

**About MTTR**
When calculating Mean Time To Resolve (MTTR), the system cannot precisely determine if incident resolution was due to human intervention. Therefore, personal MTTR data isn't included in overall MTTR calculations. Incident resolution can involve various scenarios like automatic recovery, manual closure, system timeout closure, or multiple responders handling one incident. For MTTR accuracy, the system focuses on total time from incident trigger to resolution rather than evaluating individual member contributions.

**About Data Delay**
Due to system calculation time, current data queries may show approximately one hour delay.

### Alerts TOP
Global dimension shows TOP 20 data for alert check items and alert objects
- **Alert Check Items**: Aggregates and sorts alert events by check items (from alert's check label), suggesting adjustment for frequently occurring items.
- **Alert Objects**: Aggregates and sorts alert events by objects (from alert's resource label), suggesting optimization for frequently occurring objects.

### Data Download and Export

#### Export Limitations
- Incident list exports exclude Labels data; for more detailed data, use the [Incident List](https://developer.flashcat.cloud/api-110655782) API.
- Maximum query and export limit is 100,000 records; for more data, export in time segments.

### FAQ

<details>
  <summary>How to query older data?</summary>
  The insights dashboard currently supports querying last 180 days of data. For older data, use the [API query](https://developer.flashcat.cloud/api-213441443).

<details>
  <summary>Why can't I view data by day when query range exceeds 31 days?</summary>
  Dashboard line charts support maximum 31 points, so daily view isn't available when query range exceeds 31 days.
