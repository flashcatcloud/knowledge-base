## Key Features

  - Seamlessly integrates with Feishu/Lark, Dingtalk, WeCom, and Slack.
- **Full incident lifecycle management**
  - **One-click creation**: Quickly create a dedicated war room for an active incident and sync its status in the group chat in real-time.
  - **Automatic member synchronization**: When incident responders change, new members are automatically invited to the war room.
  - **Two-way status synchronization**: The incident status is synchronized in real-time between the war room and the Flashduty platform.
  - **Operation audit**: All war room-related actions are automatically recorded in the incident timeline for review and auditing.

## FAQ

   - Currently, the following IM platforms are supported:
     - Feishu/Lark
     - Dingtalk
