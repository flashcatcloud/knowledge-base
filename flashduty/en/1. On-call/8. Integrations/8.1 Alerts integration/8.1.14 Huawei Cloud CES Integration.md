You can obtain an integration push URL through either of these two methods:

### Using Private Integration

Choose this method when you don't need to route alerts to different channels. It's simpler.

  3. Choose **Huawei Cloud CES** integration and click **Save** to generate a card
  4. Click the generated card to view the **push URL**, copy it for later use, and you're done

### Using Shared Integration

Note: When creating a notification group, Huawei Cloud will send a request to Flashduty to verify the push URL. Check the notification group's object list - alerts will only be pushed normally when the notification object status is `Confirmed`

8. Go to `Alarm-Alarm Rules` page, edit existing alarm rules or create new ones to open the `Alarm Rule Details` page
9. Select `Flashduty` as the notification group, check both `Alarm Triggered` and `Cleared` conditions. Click `OK` button to save changes
