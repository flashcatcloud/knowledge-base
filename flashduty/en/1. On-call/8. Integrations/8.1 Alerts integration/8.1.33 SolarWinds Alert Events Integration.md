### Using Shared Integration

## I. SolarWinds Alert Push Configuration

### Step 1: Configure Flashduty Alert Channel

**Prerequisites**
1. SolarWinds has five types of alerts (Anomaly, Entity, Event, Log, Metric Group), each requiring a different alert channel, so five alert channels need to be created
2. When creating Webhook channels, it's recommended to name them using the format: Type_Flashduty, for example: Anomaly_Flashduty
3. When selecting **Select Custom Body Template Based On The Alert Types**, the system will generate a default **HTTP POST Body**. **Please do not modify the generated template content**

**Getting Started**
1. Log in to your SolarWinds console
2. Find `Settings` in the left navigation bar, select `Notification Services` and click `Webhook` to enter the new alert channel page

3. Click `CREATE CONFIGURATION` to create the corresponding alert channel
4. Select **POST** for `Method`, name it according to the prerequisites, e.g., Anomaly_Flashduty
5. Fill in the integration push URL in `Destination URL` (enter the integration name on the current page, save to generate the URL)
6. Select **application/json** for `Content Type`
7. Choose the type you need to create in `Select Custom Body Template Based On The Alert Types`, e.g., Anomaly Based Alert
8. Leave `HTTP POST Body` unchanged, use the system-generated default
9. Click `CREATE` to save after configuration

10. Repeat the above steps to create other types of Webhook channels as needed

### Step 2: Use the Alert Channel Created in Step 1 in Alert Policies

1. Find `Alerts` in the left navigation bar, select `Alert Settings`
2. Create or edit existing policies (configure alert rules as needed, alert rule configuration is omitted here)
3. In the `Actions` section of the policy configuration page, select **Webhook** for `Services`
4. Select the Anomaly_Flashduty channel created in Step 1 for `Configuration`
5. Keep `Send an additional notification when the Alert is cleared` enabled
