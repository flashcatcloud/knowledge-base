You can obtain an integration push URL through either of these two methods:

### Using Private Integration

Choose this method when you don't need to route alert events to different channels - it's simpler.

  3. Choose **Volcengine CM Event** integration and click **Save** to generate a card
  4. Click the generated card to view the **push URL**, copy it for later use, and you're done

### Using Shared Integration
