You can obtain an integration push URL through either of these two methods:

### Using Private Integration

Choose this method when you don't need to route alert events to different channels. It's simpler.

  1. Go to Flashduty console, select **Channel**, and enter a channel's details page
  2. Select the **Integrations** tab, click **Add Integration** to enter the integration page
  3. Choose **Grafana** integration and click **Save** to generate a card
  4. Click the generated card to view the **push URL**, copy it for later use, and you're done
  
</details>

### Using Shared Integration

Choose this method when you need to route alerts to different channels based on the alert event's payload information.

<details>
  <summary>Expand</summary>
  
  1. Go to Flashduty console, select **Integration Center=>Alert Events** to enter the integration selection page
  2. Select **Grafana** integration:
        - **Integration Name**: Define a name for this integration
  3. Configure the default route and select the corresponding channel (after the integration is created, you can go to `Route` to configure more routing rules)
  4. Click **Save** and copy the newly generated **push URL** for later use
  5. Done

## Status Mapping
---
  
Legacy Alerting to Flashduty severity mapping:

| Legacy Alerting |  Flashduty  | Status |
| --------------- | -------- | ---- |
| alerting        | Warning  | Warning |
| no_data         | Critical | Critical |
| ok              | Ok       | Resolved |

Grafana Alerting to Flashduty severity mapping:

The system extracts the `severity`, `priority`, and `level` labels from alert events in sequence. The corresponding value will be used as Prometheus's own alert severity. If none are found, the system automatically sets the Prometheus alert severity to `warning`.

| Grafana Alerting |  Flashduty  | Status |
| ---------------- | -------- | ---- |
| critical         | Critical | Critical |
| warning          | Warning  | Warning |
| warn             | Warning  | Warning |
| info             | Info     | Info |
| acknowledged     | Info     | Info |
| unknown          | Info     | Info |
| unk              | Info     | Info |
| ok               | Ok       | Resolved |
