You can obtain an integration push URL through either of these two methods:

### Using Dedicated Integration

Choose this method when you don't need to route alert events to different channels. It's simpler and recommended.

  1. Go to the Flashduty console, select **Channel**, and enter a channel's details page
  2. Select the **Integration** tab, click **Add Integration** to enter the integration page
  3. Choose **Zilliz** integration and click **Save** to generate a card
  4. Click the generated card to view the **push URL**, copy it for later use, and you're done

</details>

### Using Shared Integration

Choose this method when you need to route alerts to different channels based on the alert event's payload information.

<details>
  <summary>Expand</summary>
  
  1. Go to the Flashduty console, select **Integration Center=>Alert Events** to enter the integration selection page
  2. Select **Zilliz** integration:
        - **Integration Name**: Define a name for this integration
  3. Configure the default route and select the corresponding channel (after the integration is created, you can go to `Route` to configure more routing rules)
  4. Click **Save** and copy the newly generated **push URL** for later use
  5. Done
