When you enable the Monit service, the system will automatically create this integration for you. This integration is used to collect alert events generated by the Monit service.

:::tips
You cannot modify or delete this integration. However, you can manage the label enrichment, alert pipeline, and routing rules under the integration.

## How to Enable Monit Alerts

Go to the `Monit` - `Alert Rules` - `Rule Details` page to configure monitoring metrics and threshold conditions, and enable alerts. You can choose to deliver alerts to multiple channels. Alert notification rules follow the escalation rules under the channel, and you can set responders for the team to assign to responders when alerts occur.

In some cases, you may want to route alerts generated by the same alert rule to different channels based on conditions. In this case, you can choose to deliver alerts directly to the integration rather than to the channels, and set routing rules under the current integration.
