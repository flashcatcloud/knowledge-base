## How to Enable RUM Alerts

Go to the `RUM` - `Application Details` - `Alert Settings` page to enable alerts. You can choose to deliver alerts to multiple channels. Alert notification rules follow the escalation rules under the channel, and you can set responders for the team to assign to responders when alerts occur.
