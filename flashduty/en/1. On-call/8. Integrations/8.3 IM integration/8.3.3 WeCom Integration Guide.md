By integrating a WeCom application, you can receive and respond to alerts within WeCom.

This document supports both [integrating third-party applications](#third-party) and [integrating custom enterprise applications](#self).


> You only need to configure one of the two methods: **Integrate third-party application** or **Integrate custom application**.

<span id="third-party"></span>

## 1. Integrate third-party application

---

> As a WeCom service provider, Flashduty offers a long-term free version of the Flashduty application. This application requires WeCom API permissions to function (passwordless login + message sending).
>
> This license currently supports **up to 60 days** free of charge. After exceeding this usage period, Flashduty needs to purchase a WeCom license for you to continue using it.

1. Visit [WeCom Admin Console](https://work.weixin.qq.com/wework_admin/frame#apps), go to Application Management → **Applications** page, and click **Add Third-party Application**.

2. Enter `Flashduty` in the search bar, and click the **Add** button after finding the application.

3. Modify the application **visibility range**. It is recommended to select all employees or specific department nodes to avoid needing to modify when new enterprise members are added. Then click **Agree to the above authorization and add** to complete the installation.

## 2. Integrate custom enterprise application

---

1. Visit [WeCom Admin Console](https://work.weixin.qq.com/wework_admin/frame#apps), go to Application Management → **Applications** page, and click **Create Application**.

   ![2025-09-18-13-06-26](https://docs-cdn.flashcat.cloud/images/png/166b4c18de5677d1fd686a5953dda6a7.png)

3. Return to the Flashduty integration configuration page and select whether WeCom is a `non-private deployment version` based on your actual situation.

   If your WeCom is a private deployment version, you need to fill in the `Endpoint` in the configuration page. This address needs to be accessible by the Flashduty service. You may consider setting up **whitelist authorization** for it.

4. Visit [WeCom Admin Console](https://work.weixin.qq.com/wework_admin/frame#apps), go to **My Enterprise** page, obtain the `Enterprise ID`, and fill it in the Flashduty integration configuration page.

5. Return to [WeCom Admin Console](https://work.weixin.qq.com/wework_admin/frame#apps), go to **Application Management** page, click on the application you created to enter the details page. Obtain the `AgentId` from the page and fill it in the Flashduty integration configuration page.

6. On the application details page, obtain the `Secret` and fill it in the Flashduty integration configuration page.

7. On the application details page, go to **Web Authorization and JS-SDK** page, click **Set Trusted Domain**.

   > The trusted domain needs to point to Flashduty's backend address `{api_host}` (can be achieved through CNAME or proxy forwarding).
   >
   > For trusted domain requirements, see the official WeCom documentation [《Internal Development Domain Configuration Guide》](https://open.work.weixin.qq.com/wwopen/common/readDocument/40754).

   Return to the Flashduty integration configuration page, fill in this domain, and complete the verification.

8. On the application details page, go to **Receive Messages** page and **Set API Reception**. Click **Random Generation** for both `Token` and `EncodingAESKey`, then copy and save the generated values.

   ![2025-09-18-13-10-03](https://docs-cdn.flashcat.cloud/images/png/ced9137a2fe74afa34d118ce279579e2.png)

   Return to the Flashduty integration configuration page, fill in the saved `Token` and `EncodingAESKey`, and click **Save** to complete the integration.

9. Copy the `Callback Address` from the Flashduty integration details page, return to the **Receive Messages** page in WeCom. In the **API Reception** settings, fill in the `Callback Address` and the `Token` and `EncodingAESKey` saved in the previous step, then click **Save**.

10. Configure **Frontend Trusted Domain**

   > The trusted domain needs to point to Flashduty's frontend address `console.flashcat.cloud` (can be implemented through CNAME or proxy forwarding).
   >
   > For requirements regarding trusted domains, please refer to the WeCom official documentation ['Enterprise Internal Development Domain Configuration Guide'](https://open.work.weixin.qq.com/wwopen/common/readDocument/40754).

   After the frontend trusted domain verification passes, configure the generated **homepage address** to the WeCom application's **workbench application homepage**.

11. Configure **Trusted IP Address**: `47.93.12.134`

   ![2025-10-14-20-28-20](https://docs-cdn.flashcat.cloud/images/png/d9c2184ba459bda0c3302e7634ccf48c.png)

## 3. Configure war room

---

> The war room feature is only supported when **custom enterprise application** mode is enabled.

After completing the previous steps, in the **Enhanced Features** module of the Flashduty integration configuration page, check **Enable War Room** to enable this feature without additional configuration.

## 4. FAQ

---

1. **After clicking the integration save button, the system reports `authorize app first`?**
   - Please check if you have completed the application installation steps. For example, can you see the Flashduty application in the WeCom workplace?
   - Please check if you have correctly configured the `Corp ID`.
2. **How to complete account linking or message sending prompts `app not linked`?**
   - Log in to the WeCom client (both desktop and mobile are acceptable), go to **Workplace**, find and open the Flashduty application.
   - The first time you enter the application, you need to log in. Select your member account and log in successfully through password or single sign-on to complete the linking of your Flashduty account and WeCom account.
   - Subsequent entries to the application will automatically log in without a password.
3. **How to send incident notifications?**
   - Before sending notifications, you must complete account linking as described in the previous question.
   - Enter the specified channel, navigate to `Escalation Rules` → **Personal Channels**, and select `WeCom` as the notification method.
   - Flashduty supports customizing WeCom notification content. You can go to the **Template Management** page to set custom templates. **The custom area can display up to 8 lines**, and excess content will be truncated by WeCom.
  ![2025-09-18-12-02-26](https://docs-cdn.flashcat.cloud/images/png/9cb6a325b4b16875fec3e0c5054be25b.png)
4. **How to handle alerts within WeCom?**
   - Click on the card message to directly enter the alert details page.
   - Click **Start Processing** to directly set the alert to `Processing` status.
   - Click **Close Directly** to directly set the alert to `Closed` status.
   - Click **Snooze for 2 hours** to directly snooze the alert for 2 hours. If you want to snooze for longer, click the `...` in the upper right corner of the card to see more snooze options.
5. **Why does the card message provide a `Status Refresh` button?**
   - According to WeCom's restrictions, after one card interaction, it can only be updated once within 72 hours. Each button operation is considered an interaction.
   - When the alert status changes, Flashduty will request to update the card content.
   - When the alert status changes frequently, the card may not be updated in real-time due to exceeding the update limit. At this time, you can click the **Refresh** button to manually get a chance to update the card status.
6. **On Mac desktop, how to set clicking card messages to open with the `system default browser`?**
   - Mac desktop uses WeCom's built-in browser to open links by default.
   - You can try using the shortcut `ctrl` + `command` + `shift` + `d` to enable debug mode, then select **Debug** → **Browser, WebView Related** → **Open Web Page with System Browser** to change how links are opened. Use the same shortcut to close debug mode, and the settings will be retained.
7. **Incident notification failed with prompt `WeCom license not activated`?**
   - Please contact Flashduty customer service or your dedicated technical support to purchase and activate the license for you.
8. **Why is the war room feature not working as expected?**
   - Please refer to the **FAQ** section of the Flashduty [War Room Introduction](https://docs.flashcat.cloud/en/flashduty/war-room?nav=01JCQ7A4N4WRWNXW8EWEHXCMF5).
9. **Why does it prompt "redirect_uri needs to use the application's trusted domain" when opening the app in the WeCom workspace?**
   - Please confirm whether the domain in the `redirect_uri` parameter of the **App Homepage** URL has completed the domain ownership verification required by WeCom. For details, see the WeCom official documentation ['Enterprise Internal Development Domain Configuration Guide'](https://open.work.weixin.qq.com/wwopen/common/readDocument/40754).
