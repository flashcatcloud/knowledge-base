## III. FAQ

---

1. **Why is the desired private channel missing from the escalation rule's channel list?**
   - Ensure that the [**Install the App**](#install-app) step has been completed successfully without any errors.
   - Go to the relevant Slack channel and run the `/invite @Flashduty` command. When you see a message like `has joined` or `has been added by xxx to xxx`, it means the app has been added successfully.
2. **Why is the desired public channel missing from the escalation rule's channel list?**
   - Add the app authorizer to the public channel.
   - Refer to the method in **Question 1** to add the app to the channel.
3. **What to do if an error occurs after clicking the `Allow` button in installation step 2?**
   - Please try again. The authorization may have failed due to a communication issue between the server and Slack. Return to the add integration page and retry.
   - If the error persists after retrying, please contact customer support.
4. **What to do if an error occurs after clicking the `Save` button in installation step 3?**
   - Please try again. This may be due to a communication error between the Flashduty server and Slack when obtaining the permanent authorization code. Return to the add integration page and retry.
   - If the error persists after retrying, please contact customer support.
5. **What to do if the Slack App reports a `not_authed` error?**
   - Please try again. This could be a temporary issue with the Slack service.
   - If the error persists after retrying, please contact customer support.
6. **What to do if the Slack App reports an `Operation timed out` error?**
   - Please try again. This may be due to a communication timeout between the server and Slack.
   - If the error persists after retrying, please contact customer support.
7. **What to do if the Slack App reports a 'This app responded with Status Code 500' error?**
   - Please try again. This could be due to an error on the Flashduty server (for example, the integration was disabled).
   - If the error persists after retrying, please contact customer support.
8. **What to do if the Slack App reports another unknown error?**
   - Please try again.
   - If the error persists after retrying, please contact customer support to record and resolve the new issue.
9. **Why is the War Room feature not working as expected?**
   - For previously authorized Slack IM integrations, you need to manually re-authorize Slack on the Flashduty integration configuration page. This allows the application to obtain the additional permissions required for the War Room feature.
   - Please refer to the **FAQ** section of the Flashduty [War Room Introduction](https://docs.flashcat.cloud/en/flashduty/war-room) document.
