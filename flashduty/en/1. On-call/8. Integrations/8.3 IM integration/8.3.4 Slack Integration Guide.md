## 3. FAQ

---

1. **The private channel I want is not in the group chat list of escalation rules?**
   - Ensure the [**Install Application**](#install-app) step has been completed successfully without errors.
   - Enter the relevant Slack channel and execute the `/invite @Flashduty` command. When you see the prompt `has joined` or `has been added by xxx to xxx`, it means the addition was successful.
2. **The public channel I want is not in the group chat list of escalation rules?**
   - Add the application authorizer to the public channel.
   - Refer to the method in **Question 1** to add the application to the channel.
3. **Error after clicking the `Allow` button in installation step 2?**
   - Please retry. This may be due to abnormal communication between the server and Slack causing authorization failure. Please return to the add data source page and try again.
   - If the error persists after retrying, please contact customer service.
4. **Error after clicking the `Save` button in installation step 3?**
   - Please retry. This may be due to abnormal communication between the Flashduty server and Slack when obtaining the permanent authorization code. Please return to the add data source page and try again.
   - If the error persists after retrying, please contact customer service.
5. **Slack App prompts `not_authed` error?**
   - Please retry, this may be a temporary issue with Slack service.
   - If the error persists after retrying, please contact customer service.
6. **Slack App prompts `Operation timed out` error?**
   - Please retry. This may be due to communication timeout between the server and Slack.
   - If the error persists after retrying, please contact customer service.
7. **Slack App prompts `This app responded with Status Code 500` error?**
   - Please retry. This may be an error on the Flashduty server side (for example, the data source is closed).
   - If the error persists after retrying, please contact customer service.
8. **Slack App prompts other unknown errors?**
   - Please retry.
   - If the error persists after retrying, please contact customer service to record and resolve new issues.
9. **Why is the war room feature not working as expected?**
   - For previously authorized Slack IM integrations, you need to manually reauthorize Slack in the Flashduty integration configuration page to grant the application the additional permissions required for the war room feature.
   - Please refer to the **FAQ** section of the Flashduty [War Room Introduction](https://docs.flashcat.cloud/en/flashduty/war-room?nav=01JCQ7A4N4WRWNXW8EWEHXCMF5).
