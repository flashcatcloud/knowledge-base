Configure alert webhooks to receive HTTP callbacks at your specified URL when alerts have specific actions (such as triggering or closing). The callback content includes the latest key information about the alert, allowing integration with your custom tools.

## III. FAQ

1. **Is there a response timeout for the service?**

   - The service must respond within 1 second, after which the response is considered failed

2. **Will failed pushes continue to be pushed?**

   - Currently, FlashDuty pushes only once, though retry mechanisms may be introduced in the future. Retries may also occur due to middleware timeouts, so implement idempotent processing

3. **How is push order guaranteed?**

   - In theory, events for the same alert are pushed in chronological order, but retries and other situations may cause out-of-order delivery
   - Services can filter based on event_time; if a later event has been received, earlier events can be filtered out. Each push carries the latest complete information, so occasional event loss is acceptable

4. **Trusted IP whitelist for push sources?**
   - {ip_whitelist}
   - May be updated in the future, please check periodically
