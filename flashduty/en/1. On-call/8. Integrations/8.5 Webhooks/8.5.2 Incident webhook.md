## III. FAQ

1. **Is there a response timeout for the service?**

   - Services must respond within 2 second, responses after 2 second are considered failed

2. **Will failed pushes continue to be pushed?**

  For specific network errors, retries will be attempted up to a maximum of 1 times:
    - context deadline exceeded (excluding cases involving "awaiting headers")
    - i/o timeout
    - eof

3. **How is push order guaranteed?**

   - In theory, events for the same incident are pushed in chronological order, but retries may cause out-of-order delivery
   - Services can filter based on event_time; if a later event has been received, earlier events can be filtered out. Each push carries complete, up-to-date information, so occasional event loss is acceptable

4. **Trusted IP whitelist for push sources?**
   - {ip_whitelist}
   - May be updated in the future, please check periodically
