Through ServiceDesk Plus sync webhook, Flashduty incidents are associated and synchronized with ServiceDesk Plus requests to achieve integration between Flashduty and ServiceDesk Plus.

This integration is based on the official v3 API protocol provided by ServiceDesk Plus and is compatible with its interface specifications. If you are using an on-premises deployment version, please confirm whether its API supports the v3 version. Additionally, there are differences in authorization configuration between the cloud and on-premises  of ServiceDesk Plus. Please refer to the relevant documentation for specific configurations.

  - [Cloud](#cloud-version)
  - [On-premises](#on-premises)

When configuring this integration, if you choose the sync direction as From_ServiceDesk_Plus, you can skip the authorization-related configuration and directly refer to [Configure Sync](#configure-sync).

## Cloud  <span id="cloud-version"></span>

### In ServiceDesk Plus
#### Step 1 Create Authorization Application
Please select the corresponding Developer Console address according to your ServiceDesk Plus service region: [Data Centres](https://www.manageengine.com/products/service-desk/sdpod-v3-api/getting-started/data-centers.html)

1. Log in to the Developer Console, select `Self Client` type Client and create it.
2. Click `Generate Code`, fill in the `Scope`: **SDPOnDemand.requests.ALL,SDPOnDemand.setup.READ,SDPOnDemand.custommodule.READ**. Refer to [official documentation](https://www.manageengine.com/products/service-desk/sdpod-v3-api/getting-started/oauth-2.0.html#scopes) for permission scope.

3. Select the maximum **10 minutes** for `Time Duration`, fill in the `Scope Description` as customizable, for example: For Flashduty sync use, and create.
4. Copy the generated **Code**, **Client ID** and **Client Secret** for backup.

###### Note: The Code is only valid for 10 minutes and can only be used once, so after obtaining the Code, please complete the [Integration Authorization](#integration-authorization) as soon as possible within the validity period.

### In Flashduty
#### Step 2 Integration Authorization <span id="integration-authorization"></span>
Please select the corresponding API Endpoint and Accounts Server URL according to your ServiceDesk Plus service region: [Data Centres](https://www.manageengine.com/products/service-desk/sdpod-v3-api/getting-started/data-centers.html)

1. Select **Cloud** for `Platform Type`, fill in `API Endpoint` and `Accounts Server URL`.
2. Fill in the `Code`, `Client ID` and `Client Secret` generated in the **Create Authorization Application** step into the corresponding edit boxes and click Next to complete [Integration Configuration](#integration-configuration) (if an error occurs, please re-obtain the Code or contact technical support to troubleshoot the problem).

## On-premises <span id="on-premises"></span>
### In ServiceDesk Plus
#### Step 1 Generate API Key
1. Log in to the ServiceDesk Plus console, click `Generate API Key` in the personal center.
2. Select **Never Expires** for `Token Expiration Time`, copy the generated **Token** for backup, and complete [Integration Authorization](#on-premises-integration-authorization).

###### Note: The user who generates the API key needs to have relevant permissions, such as create/update requests, obtain template/priority/custom field lists and other permissions. If the permissions are insufficient, it will cause the integration configuration to fail. It is recommended to use an administrator role to generate.

### In Flashduty
#### Step 2 Integration Authorization <span id="on-premises-integration-authorization"></span>
1. Select **On-premises** for `Platform Type`, fill in `API Endpoint`.
2. Fill in the generated **Token** into the corresponding edit box and click Next to complete [Integration Configuration](#integration-configuration).


## General Configuration

### In Flashduty
#### Step 1 Integration Configuration <span id="integration-configuration"></span>

1. **Integration Name:** Define a name for the current integration.
2. **Management Team:** When a management team is selected, only team members and tenant administrators can edit this integration.
3. **Sync Direction:**

    - To_ServiceDesk_Plus: Sync Flashduty incidents to ServiceDesk Plus.
    - From_ServiceDesk_Plus: Sync ServiceDesk Plus requests to Flashduty.
    - Two-way: Bidirectional sync between Flashduty and ServiceDesk Plus.
    
4. **Trigger Mode**:
    - Auto Trigger: Requires configuration of corresponding conditions, Flashduty will automatically sync incidents that meet the conditions to ServiceDesk Plus.
    - Manual Trigger: Requires manual triggering of ServiceDesk Plus sync in the More Actions section of the incident details page (the integration configuration name is the trigger name).

5. **Channel:** Select the channel where this integration takes effect.
6. **Request Template:** Select the template to use when creating requests.
7. **Severity Mapping:** The mapping relationship between Flashduty severity and ServiceDesk Plus priority. For default mapping relationship, please refer to [Priority Mapping](#priority-mapping).
8. **Custom Field Mapping:** You can map labels or custom fields in incidents to corresponding text fields in ServiceDesk Plus tickets to achieve automatic information filling. This feature supports syncing common context information (such as service name, instance address, metric name, etc.) to ServiceDesk Plus for subsequent troubleshooting and tracking.
    - Only supports target fields of single-line text or multi-line text type.
    - Supports extracting values from incident labels (such as service, instance) or custom attributes.
    - If the source field is empty, the target field will also remain empty and will not overwrite existing content.
    - Mapping configuration is managed uniformly in integration settings without manual filling each time.

9. **Assignee Mapping:** When Flashduty incidents are synced to ServiceDesk Plus and need to be automatically assigned to Technician or Group, you can get the value of Flashduty incident labels as the assignee (if the corresponding assignee does not exist, it will cause sync failure, please choose carefully).

10. Click `Save` to complete the configuration.

### In ServiceDesk Plus
#### Step 2 Create Requester

## FAQ

<details>
  <summary> Can the Scope be changed</summary>
  No, the Scope currently used is already the smallest unit. Flashduty needs to perform get/create/update operations when syncing requests with ServiceDesk Plus, and needs to obtain priority/custom field lists when configuring integration, so corresponding permission support is required.
