Through Link integration, you can quickly access external links by obtaining key parameters from incident attributes, labels, and other information

## Configuration Guide

Link integration supports extracting key parameters from incident attributes, labels, and other information to enable quick navigation to external systems. Through automated parameter filling and redirection, it eliminates manual input, improving the efficiency of problem identification and resolution. This feature is applicable to incident troubleshooting, performance monitoring, and system debugging scenarios, helping optimize operations processes and enhance response speed and accuracy.

### Opening Methods

#### 1. Pop-up Window
Opens a window in the current incident details page, maintaining the original interface state, suitable for quick viewing or returning after operations

#### 2. New Tab
Opens the link in a new browser tab, suitable for scenarios where you need to retain the current operation context while accessing external content

### URL Configuration

When referencing content from labels, start with labels.; when referencing custom fields, start with fields.; when referencing incident attributes, reference them directly, such as .title .severity

#### Retrieving from Incident Labels
Supports dynamic value retrieval through ${} syntax to construct request URLs. For example, parameter values can be automatically filled from incident labels, requiring no manual input:
  
```
https://cmdb.com/vm?sn=${labels.sn}
```

In the above example, ${labels.sn} indicates that the sn label value from the incident will be dynamically injected into the URL. If the incident data contains sn=VM123456, the final request URL will be:

```
https://cmdb.com/vm?sn=VM123456
```


#### Retrieving from Custom Fields
Supports dynamic value retrieval through ${} syntax to construct request URLs. For example, parameter values can be automatically filled from custom fields, requiring no manual input:
  
```
https://cmdb.com/vm?sn=${fields.sn}
```

In the above example, ${fields.sn} indicates that the sn custom field value will be dynamically injected into the URL. If the custom field data contains sn=VM123456, the final request URL will be:

```
https://cmdb.com/vm?sn=VM123456
```

### Notes

1. When referenced content does not exist, Link integration will still generate the corresponding link but will not be able to retrieve the value
2. Each channel can bind up to three Link integrations
3. Pay attention to reference syntax; improper variable reference formatting will result in failure to retrieve corresponding values
