An incident represents an ongoing issue or a matter that needs attention. Incidents are typically triggered by alerts and often associate with a series of similar alerts.

## Incidents, Alerts, and Events
---

When Flashduty receives an alert event (such as a Zabbix notification), the system automatically triggers an alert, which in turn triggers an incident. Multiple similar active alerts may be grouped into a single incident for unified assignment, notification, and handling.

Simply put: **an incident is a combination of similar alerts**. Without noise reduction, an incident equals a single alert. Conversely, with noise reduction enabled, an incident equals multiple associated alerts. To learn more about alert noise reduction models, please read [Understanding Noise Reduction](doc-4185939).

## Incident Severity, Status, and Progress
---

### Severity

- **Info**: Minor issues where services remain operational; serves as a status reminder with no immediate action required.
- **Warning**: Issues that may indicate potential problems or impending issues; early intervention recommended to prevent escalation.
- **Critical**: Severe issues causing widespread service disruption or outages affecting users; immediate intervention required.

Incidents, alerts, and events all use these three severity levels. **Severity levels are capitalized**, which is important when using the API. The severity determination rules are as follows:

- **Event Severity**: Different integration sources (like Zabbix and Nightingale) have varying severity enumerations, which Flashduty maps to these three standard levels. For specific mapping relationships, please refer to the integration documentation.
- **Alert Severity**: Equals the highest severity level among associated events.
- **Incident Severity**: Equals the highest severity level among associated alerts.

### Progress Status

- **Pending**: Default status when an incident is triggered; system initiates automatic assignment, sets responders, and sends notifications.
- **In Progress**: Status changes when any responder clicks **acknowledge**. Responders may be in either **acknowledged** or **unacknowledged** states, but at least one must be "acknowledged". Returns to "Pending" if all responders un-acknowledge.
- **Closed**: Status changes when any responder clicks **close the incident** or when the **incident auto-resolves**.

### Incident Status

Alert status represents the incident's state in the original monitoring system: "resolved" or "unresolved". An incident's status is determined entirely by its associated alerts.

- **Resolved**: All associated alerts are resolved; incident automatically resolves.
- **Unresolved**: At least one associated alert remains unresolved.

Automatic incident resolution leads to automatic closure (progress status); however, manually closing an incident does not affect its resolution status.

## Incident Labels
---

Labels are a very important concept in Flashduty. They describe the information of alerts and incidents in different dimensions and are widely used in filtering, searching, and aggregation scenarios.

**How are labels generated?**

Labels are extracted from the event message body reported by the original alert system. Different sources have different extraction methods. Generally, we follow the principle of **taking everything**. For example, for alert events from Prometheus, Flashduty extracts Labels and Annotations from the Payload.

Labels can only be obtained through event reporting and cannot be manually modified or added. The labels of an automatically triggered incident are always equal to the labels of its first associated alert. The labels of a manually triggered incident are always empty.

Flashduty provides a label enhancement solution, which is used to automatically generate labels. Please read [Configuring Label Enhancement](http://docs.flashcat.cloud/en/flashduty/label-enrichment-settings) for more information.

## Incident Lifecycle
---

**1. Trigger a New Incident**

**Automatic Trigger**: Flashduty receives an alert event from an integration (such as a Zabbix notification), and the system automatically triggers an alert, which in turn triggers an incident.

**Manual Trigger**: Manually create an incident in the Flashduty console by clicking the **Create Incident** button and filling in the title, description, severity, etc.

**2. Assignment and Notification**

After a new incident is triggered, Flashduty will match the incident with the corresponding assignment policy under the collaboration space. If a match is found, the system will assign the incident to individuals, team members, or值班人员并进行通知。**If no match is found, the incident will not be assigned to anyone and no notification will be sent**。

You can set different assignment policies for different time periods or types of incidents to achieve flexible assignment. The system allows you to set multiple assignment stages in a single assignment policy. If the responder in the current stage does not complete the incident confirmation and handling within the specified time, the system will automatically upgrade to the next stage. Upgrading is equivalent to reassigning the incident to other responders.

You can flexibly arrange notification methods in the assignment policy. Flashduty supports a wide range of group chat and one-on-one chat notification channels. One-on-one chat is a one-to-one push channel (such as voice, SMS, and email), and group chat is a push channel to the group chat (such as Feishu, Dingtalk, and Slack), and the responder is reminded.

:::highlight orange 💡 
Note that **an incident can only be assigned before it is notified**. Without assignment, there is no notification.
:::

If you assign the incident to a值班表 (轮空) that no one is on-call, the system will not notify any individual, but it will still notify the group chat if you have configured the group chat channel.

**3. Acknowledgment and Resolution**

On-Call responders receive notifications and can immediately acknowledge the incident. You can acknowledge the incident in **voice calls** and **instant messages**. After acknowledging, the incident progress status will change to **In Progress**.

:::highlight orange 💡 
Flashduty currently does not restrict incidents to be acknowledged only by "assigned responders". Any responder who sees the incident can click to acknowledge.
:::

**Close the incident** will lead to the incident progress status changing to **Closed**. If the incident associated alerts auto-resolve, the incident will also auto-close. Conversely, if you manually close the incident, it will lead to all associated alerts auto-closing. This means that these alerts will not be merged into any new events.


## Incident Timeline
---

Each incident has a timeline for tracing back the changes and operations at different points in time. For example, when the incident was notified, through which channel, and the result of the notification.

## Triggering Incidents
---

### Triggering Incidents via Integrations

Flashduty supports most common monitoring systems, including Prometheus, Zabbix, Nightingale, and cloud monitoring. Please refer to [Alert Integration](https://docs.flashcat.cloud/en/flashduty/nightingale-integration-guide) for specific steps.

:::highlight orange 💡 
Flashduty supports both Private Integration and shared integration modes. Incidents will be triggered in the Private Integration space under the collaboration space.
Or, the alerts will be delivered to the shared integration center, then configured with routing to deliver alerts to different collaboration spaces.
:::

### Triggering Incidents via API

Flashduty provides a custom event standard that allows you to report alerts via standard protocols, suitable for any un-integrated monitoring systems. Please read [Custom Event](https://docs.flashcat.cloud/en/flashduty/custom-alert-integration-guide) for details.

:::highlight orange 💡 
To ensure the stability of the entire system, Flashduty currently has a **200qps** frequency limit for API reporting. If the limit is exceeded, the reporting will be rejected.
:::

:::highlight orange 💡 
Please ensure that you will actively close alerts or set up automatic incident closure in the collaboration space. If there are too many incidents, the performance of the console will decrease significantly. At this time, the system may close historical incidents without any notification.
:::

### Triggering Incidents via Email

Flashduty provides an email integration that allows you to report alerts via email, suitable for all monitoring systems that support email reminders. Please read [Custom Event](https://docs.flashcat.cloud/en/flashduty/email-integration-guide) for details.

:::highlight orange 💡 
You can set a specific email prefix for each integration. You can also contact us to set up a convenient domain name for the main account. For example, order-service@tesla.flashcat.cloud.
