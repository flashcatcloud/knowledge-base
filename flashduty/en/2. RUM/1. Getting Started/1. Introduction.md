## What is Real User Monitoring?

---

Real User Monitoring (RUM) is an innovative technology that tracks and analyzes the actual experience of real users as they interact with your web applications. Unlike traditional simulation testing, RUM collects data directly from users' browsers, showing you how your application performs in real-world conditions.

Flashduty RUM enables developers, operations engineers, and business stakeholders to gain intuitive insights into application performance, promptly identify issues, and continuously optimize user experience—all powered by real-time collection and analysis of end-user browser data.

### Core Benefits

1. **Performance monitoring**: Monitor key performance metrics in real-time, including page load time, resource loading efficiency, and JavaScript execution status, to quickly identify bottlenecks affecting user experience.

2. **Error monitoring**: Automatically capture JavaScript errors, network failures, and other issues impacting users, with rich contextual information to help quickly locate and resolve problems.

3. **Insights**: Analyze performance of images, scripts, API calls, and other resources in depth to optimize loading speed, understand data trends, reduce bandwidth consumption, and minimize errors.

## Why Choose Flashduty RUM?

---

1. **Comprehensive visualization**: Gain a holistic understanding of application performance across different browsers, devices, and regions from the user's perspective.

2. **Early warning**: Identify and resolve issues before they become widespread, significantly improving application stability.

3. **Data-driven**: Develop optimization strategies based on real user data, eliminating subjective assumptions.

4. **Ecosystem integration**: Deeply integrated with the Flashduty monitoring system, enabling incident alerts through channels and combining trace tracking for end-to-end problem identification and analysis across frontend and backend.

5. **Lightweight and efficient**: JavaScript SDK uses a lightweight design that minimizes performance impact while ensuring robust data collection.

## How RUM Works

---

Flashduty RUM collects data by embedding a lightweight JavaScript SDK in your web application. The SDK primarily collects the following types of data:

1. **Page visits**: Records page loading processes, navigation timing, and user environment information.

2. **Resource loading**: Detailed tracking of loading performance for images, scripts, API calls, and other resources.

3. **User interactions**: Collects user actions such as clicks, form submissions, and custom events.

4. **Error information**: Captures JavaScript exceptions, network failures, and other issues.

5. **Long task tracking**: Monitors time-consuming JavaScript tasks that might cause page stuttering.

This data is transmitted to the Flashduty backend in real-time for processing and analysis, ultimately presented as intuitive dashboards and reports to help you fully understand your application's performance and user experience.
