## What is Real User Monitoring?

---

Real User Monitoring (RUM) is an innovative technology that tracks and analyzes the actual experience of real users as they interact with your Web and native applications. Unlike traditional simulation testing, RUM collects data directly from users, showing you how your application performs in real-world conditions.

Flashduty RUM enables developers, operations engineers, and business stakeholders to gain intuitive insights into application performance, promptly identify issues, and continuously optimize user experience—all powered by real-time collection and analysis of end-user data.

### Core Benefits

1. **Quickly identify root causes**: Perform multi-dimensional drill-down analysis through the Session Explorer linking various events (page visits, resource loading, user interactions, etc.), combined with trace linking to connect frontend and backend data, quickly locating problem sources from user side to server side.
2. **Comprehensively improve application stability**: Automatically capture JavaScript errors, client crashes, network failures, and other issues affecting users, providing rich contextual information to discover and resolve problems before they spread.
3. **Continuously optimize user experience**: Master key performance metrics in real-time including page load time, resource loading efficiency, and JavaScript execution status, scientifically guiding performance optimization based on real user data, eliminating guesswork.
4. **Data-driven decision optimization**: Deeply understand APP crash situations, resource performance, and data trends through analysis dashboards, providing reliable basis for product iteration and business decisions.
5. **Build a complete observability system**: Deeply integrated with the Flashduty monitoring system, enabling incident alerts through collaboration spaces, connecting frontend and backend monitoring links, and establishing a unified observability platform.

## Why Choose Flashduty RUM?

---

1. **Out-of-the-box**: Quick integration in 5 minutes, no complex configuration needed, supporting unified monitoring across Web, iOS, and Android, reducing integration and maintenance costs.

2. **Ecosystem integration**: Deeply integrated with Flashduty and Flashcat monitoring systems, enabling incident alerts through collaboration spaces, combined with trace linking to achieve end-to-end problem identification and analysis across frontend and backend, providing a one-stop observability solution.

3. **Lightweight and efficient**: SDK uses a lightweight design that minimizes impact on user experience while ensuring complete data collection.

4. **Flexible deployment**: Supports both SaaS cloud services and private deployment modes to meet different enterprise data security and compliance requirements.

## How RUM Works

---

Flashduty RUM collects data by embedding a lightweight SDK in your Web application or native (Android, iOS) application. The SDK primarily collects the following types of data:

1. **Page visits**: Records page loading processes, navigation timing, and user environment information.

2. **Resource loading**: Detailed tracking of loading performance for images, scripts, API calls, and other resources.

3. **User interactions**: Collects user actions such as clicks, form submissions, and custom events.

4. **Error information**: Captures JavaScript exceptions, network failures, and other issues.

5. **Long task tracking**: Monitors time-consuming tasks that might cause page stuttering.

This data is transmitted to the Flashduty backend in real-time for processing and analysis, ultimately presented as intuitive dashboards and reports to help you fully understand your application's performance and user experience.
