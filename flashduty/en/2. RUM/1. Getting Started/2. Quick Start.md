## Quick Start Guide

---

Get started with Flashduty RUM in just a few simple steps:

### Basic Process

### Create a RUM Application

A RUM application is a container for frontend performance monitoring data. We recommend creating RUM applications based on business systems or applications, such as: official website, e-commerce platform, admin dashboard, etc.

1. Go to the RUM application list page and click **Create RUM Application**
2. Enter the application name, management team, access level, and alert configuration
3. Click confirm to create

Visit [Application Management](https://docs.flashcat.cloud/en/flashduty/rum/application-management?nav=01JCQ7A4N4WRWNXW8EWEHXCMF5) to learn more.

### Integrate the SDK

After creating a RUM application, you need to integrate the SDK into your application:

1. Get the SDK integration configuration information from the application details page
2. Choose the appropriate SDK integration method based on your application type:
   - npm package import
   - CDN import

Visit [SDK Documentation](https://docs.flashcat.cloud/en/flashduty/rum/sdk-integration?nav=01JCQ7A4N4WRWNXW8EWEHXCMF5) for detailed setup instructions.

### Data Reporting

Once the SDK integration is complete, the system will automatically collect the following data:

- Page performance metrics (loading time, first screen time, etc.)
- Resource loading performance
- User behavior data
- Errors and exceptions
- Network request performance

Visit [Data Collection](https://docs.flashcat.cloud/en/flashduty/rum/data-collection?nav=01JCQ7A4N4WRWNXW8EWEHXCMF5) to learn about data types and storage policies.

### Feature Experience

In the RUM console, you can:

1. View real-time performance and error data
2. Analyze user behavior
3. Optimize performance metrics
4. Monitor errors and exceptions

Visit [Performance Monitoring](https://docs.flashcat.cloud/en/flashduty/rum/performance-overview?nav=01JCQ7A4N4WRWNXW8EWEHXCMF5) and [Error Tracking](https://docs.flashcat.cloud/en/flashduty/rum/error-tracking-overview?nav=01JCQ7A4N4WRWNXW8EWEHXCMF5) to learn more.

### Formal Subscription

Currently, the RUM service is in whitelist public beta, and all features are completely free. When the public beta ends, we will notify you to switch to a formal subscription or cancel the trial.

When officially launched, RUM will be charged based on the number of Sessions, and a certain level of free quota will be provided.
