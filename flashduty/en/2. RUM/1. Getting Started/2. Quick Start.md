### Create a RUM Application

A RUM application is a container for frontend performance monitoring data. We recommend creating RUM applications based on business systems or applications, such as: official website, e-commerce platform, admin dashboard, etc.

1. Go to the RUM application list page and click **Create RUM Application**
2. Enter the application name, management team, access level, and alert configuration
3. Click confirm to create

Visit [Application Management](https://docs.flashcat.cloud/en/flashduty/rum/application-management?nav=01JCQ7A4N4WRWNXW8EWEHXCMF5) to learn more.

### Integrate the SDK

After creating a RUM application, you need to integrate the SDK into your application:

1. Get the SDK integration configuration information from the application details page
2. Choose the appropriate SDK integration method based on your application type. Learn more through the following links:
