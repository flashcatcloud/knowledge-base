## Quick Start Guide

Get started with Flashduty RUM in just a few simple steps:

### Basic Process

### Create a RUM Application

A RUM application is a container for frontend performance monitoring data. We recommend creating RUM applications based on business systems or applications, such as: official website, e-commerce platform, admin dashboard, etc.

1. Go to the RUM application list page and click **Create RUM Application**
2. Enter the application name, management team, access level, and alert configuration
3. Click confirm to create

### Integrate the SDK

After creating a RUM application, you need to integrate the SDK into your application:

1. Get the SDK integration configuration information from the application details page
2. Choose the appropriate SDK integration method based on your application type:
   - npm package import
   - CDN import
3. Complete the integration configuration according to the SDK documentation

### Data Reporting

Once the SDK integration is complete, the system will automatically collect the following data:

- Page performance metrics (loading time, first screen time, etc.)
- Resource loading performance
- User behavior data
- Errors and exceptions
- Network request performance

### Feature Experience
