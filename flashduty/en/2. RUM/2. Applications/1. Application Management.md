A RUM application is a container for frontend performance monitoring data, used to collect, store, and analyze real user experience data in frontend applications. An application represents a monitored frontend project, which can be a website, mobile application, or single-page application.

We recommend creating RUM applications based on business systems or applications, such as: official website, e-commerce platform, admin dashboard, etc.

Each application has its own `applicationId` and `clientToken` to identify data sources and ensure data security. After creating an application, you need to integrate the SDK into your frontend code to begin data collection and monitoring.

## Application Permissions

To meet special business requirements, RUM applications provide flexible permission management options (access levels), ensuring information is only visible to certain members or teams. Here are the two main permission settings:

- **Public:** The application is visible to all users. All users can view the data collected by this application and handle issues under this application.
- **Private:** Only the application creator, account administrators (Account Admin), and the owner account can view the data collected by this application. Other members who need to view the content can do so through shared incident links.

## Creating an Application

You can quickly create an application through the RUM product guidance page

- **Application Type**: Choose the frontend technology type for your application. Currently, only `JavaScript (JS)` is supported.
- **Management Team**: Set the management team for the application. **Team members have full operational permissions for the application**, while non-creators have read-only access to the application's configuration.
- **Geographic Information**: By default, automatic user data collection is enabled. If you need to disable automatic user data collection for client IP or geographic location data, turn off the geographic information collection switch. For details, see [RUM Browser Data Collection](https://docs.flashcat.cloud/en/flashduty/rum/data-collection?nav=01JCQ7A4N4WRWNXW8EWEHXCMF5).
- **Alert Configuration**: By default, alert notifications are automatically enabled to help you promptly handle errors. For details, see [Issue Alerting][https://docs.flashcat.cloud/en/flashduty/rum/issue-alerting?nav=01JCQ7A4N4WRWNXW8EWEHXCMF5]

## SDK Configuration

You can modify parameters in the application configuration-SDK configuration to preview the SDK initialization code in real-time, allowing you to quickly integrate the SDK. For more configuration instructions, see [Initialization Parameters](https://docs.flashcat.cloud/en/flashduty/rum/sdk-integration?nav=01JCQ7A4N4WRWNXW8EWEHXCMF5#initialization-parameters)

:::tip
Modifying SDK configuration in application management will not take effect in real-time on already integrated clients. All configuration changes need to be updated in your frontend code and redeployed to take effect. This means that when you adjust parameters such as sampling rate, service name, etc., you need to correspondingly update the SDK initialization parameters in your frontend code and redeploy the application.

### How to Define Services?

A service is an independent, deployable code repository that maps to a set of pages.

- If your application is built as a whole, then your RUM application has one service name for that application.
- If your browser application is built as separate repositories for multiple pages, edit the default service name throughout the lifecycle of your application.
