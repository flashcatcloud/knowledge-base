## Overview

When integrating any SDK into an Android application, understanding its performance impact is crucial for maintaining a good user experience. The Flashcat RUM SDK is designed with performance in mind and provides transparent measurement data to help you make informed integration decisions.

## Performance Benchmark

To evaluate the actual performance impact of the SDK on your application, we conducted performance benchmarks under typical usage scenarios. The following SDK modules were enabled during testing:

- `fc-sdk-android-rum`: RUM core functionality
- `fc-sdk-android-trace`: Distributed tracing
- `fc-sdk-android-okhttp`: Network request tracking

The SDK was initialized with default configuration and simulated common user operations (such as page views, scrolling lists, network requests, etc.).

### Test Results

| Metric | With SDK | Without SDK | Impact |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Peak CPU Usage | ~27% | ~25% | +2% |
| Peak Memory Usage | ~435 MB | ~437 MB | Negligible |
| App Launch Time | ~245 ms | ~230 ms | +15 ms |
| APK Size | +500 KB | - | ~0.5 MB |
| Network Usage | ~70 KB sent / ~20 KB received | - | Varies with event volume |

**Notes**:

- The above data are reference values under typical scenarios; actual impact may vary depending on application complexity, device performance, and SDK configuration
- Memory usage increase is minimal and may not be noticeable in some scenarios
- Network traffic depends on the number of collected events and sampling rate configuration

### Performance Impact Details

#### CPU Usage

The SDK's CPU impact primarily comes from:
- Event collection and processing
- Data batching and compression
- Network request reporting

The SDK uses asynchronous processing and batch reporting mechanisms to avoid blocking the main thread, ensuring it does not affect the application's UI responsiveness.

#### Memory Usage

The SDK uses a fixed-size memory buffer to store pending event data, which does not grow indefinitely over time. Stale data is automatically cleaned up to ensure it does not consume excessive memory.

#### Launch Time

The SDK initialization process is optimized, with launch time impact controlled to milliseconds. It is recommended to initialize the SDK as early as possible in `Application.onCreate()` to capture the complete application startup process.

#### Package Size

The SDK uses a modular design, allowing you to include only the necessary functional modules to minimize the impact on APK size.

#### Network Usage

The SDK employs the following strategies to optimize network usage:
- **Batch reporting**: Events are cached locally first and sent in batches to reduce the number of network requests
- **Data compression**: Reported data is compressed to reduce transmission traffic
- **Intelligent scheduling**: Upload timing is intelligently scheduled based on network status and battery level

## Continuous Performance Monitoring

Performance regression testing is conducted before each SDK release to ensure new versions do not introduce performance issues.

### Performance Optimization Recommendations

If you have specific performance requirements, consider the following optimization measures:

1. **Adjust sampling rate**: Reduce the number of collected events by configuring the sampling rate

```kotlin
val rumConfig = RumConfiguration.Builder(applicationId)
    .setSessionSampleRate(80f) // Sample 80% of sessions
    .build()
```

2. **Enable features on demand**: Only enable necessary tracking features

```kotlin
val rumConfig = RumConfiguration.Builder(applicationId)
    .trackUserInteractions(false) // Disable user interaction tracking
    .trackLongTasks(false) // Disable long task tracking
    .build()
```

3. **Configure upload strategy**: Adjust batch upload size and frequency

## Offline Data Storage

When the device is offline, the SDK stores data locally with strict storage space limits:

- Uses fixed-size disk cache
- Expired data is automatically cleaned up
- Cached data will not affect device storage space
