## SDK Module Overview

Flashcat iOS SDK consists of the following modules:

| Module Name     | Functionality                                | Platform Support         |
| --------------- | -------------------------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| FlashcatCore    | Core SDK providing basic features            | iOS, iPadOS, tvOS, macOS |
| FlashcatRUM     | RUM data collection and reporting            | iOS, iPadOS, tvOS        |
| FlashcatWebView | WebView integration support                  | iOS, iPadOS              |
| FlashcatCrash   | Crash reporting (integrates PLCrashReporter) | iOS, iPadOS, tvOS        |

## Third-Party Dependencies

Flashcat iOS SDK depends on the following third-party libraries:

| Library Name    | Version | Purpose                 |
| --------------- | ------- | ----------------------- |
| PLCrashReporter | 1.12.0  | Crash report collection |

## Known Limitations

### SwiftUI

- SwiftUI views need manual addition of `.trackRUMView()` modifier to be tracked
- Using `.trackRUMTapAction()` within `List` may affect default gesture behavior
- For `List` elements, custom action API is recommended

### macOS and visionOS

- macOS and visionOS are not officially supported platforms
- Some UIKit-dependent features may not work properly on these platforms
- Future version compatibility is not guaranteed

### Catalyst

- Catalyst mode only supports builds, some features may be limited at runtime
- Thorough testing is recommended before actual use

## Minimum Deployment Requirements

To ensure SDK works properly, please verify:

1. **Minimum OS version**: iOS 12.0 / iPadOS 12.0 / tvOS 12.0
2. **Minimum Xcode version**: Xcode 14.0
3. **Minimum Swift version**: Swift 5.0
4. **Network permissions**: App needs network access permission to report data
5. **Storage space**: SDK requires small amount of local storage for caching offline data

## Performance Impact

Flashcat iOS SDK is designed to be lightweight with minimal impact on app performance:

- **CPU usage**: < 1%
- **Memory usage**: < 10 MB
- **Package size increase**: Approximately 2-3 MB (depending on integrated modules)
- **Startup time impact**: < 100ms

## Update Strategy

- **Major version updates**: May contain incompatible changes requiring code adjustments
- **Minor version updates**: New features, backward compatible
- **Patch version updates**: Bug fixes, fully backward compatible

Regular updates to the latest stable SDK version are recommended for optimal performance and security.
