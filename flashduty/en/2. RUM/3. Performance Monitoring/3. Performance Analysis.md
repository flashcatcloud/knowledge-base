## Performance Data Analysis

The performance data analysis page helps identify the root causes of browser performance issues by analyzing real user traffic data. Browser metrics such as Core Web Vitals and custom loading time metrics are used to troubleshoot slow page loading. These metrics evaluate the complete page loading time from the user's perspective.

## Accessing Performance Analysis

Navigate to the Performance Monitoring menu, where you can analyze performance experience through different perspectives using either list or tree views.

**Resource Perspective**

- Switch to list view to see data for various metrics across top pages sorted by page. Quickly view the overall picture of metrics through color indicators in front of each metric to identify metrics that need improvement.
- Hover over each metric to see its current level under the standard.
- Click on each record to view detailed metrics for that page.

**Metrics Perspective**

- Switch to tree view to see a list of resources that need optimization from the perspective of a specific metric.
- You can switch between different metrics to view their distribution.
- After selecting a metric, you'll see resources categorized as `Good`, `Poor`, and `Average`, with their distribution and proportion, allowing you to quickly locate problematic resources.
- Click on the block representing a page to view detailed metrics for that page for further diagnosis.
