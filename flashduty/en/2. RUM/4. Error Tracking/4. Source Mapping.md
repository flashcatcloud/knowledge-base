# Flashduty CLI Source Management and Error Tracking

## Overview

[Flashduty CLI](https://github.com/flashcatcloud/flashcat-cli) is a command line tool forked from `datadog-cli` that allows users to upload `sourcemap` files to the Flashduty server. Through `sourcemaps`, frontend developers can track and debug errors more efficiently. Users can view uploaded `sourcemap` files in the "Application Management" - "Source Management" menu, and generate scripts for local execution through the upload panel. This document will provide detailed information about the purpose of `sourcemaps`, methods for generating and uploading them, management approaches, and how to use `sourcemaps` in the error tracking module to precisely locate issues.

## Why Do We Need SourceMaps?

In modern frontend development, JavaScript and CSS files are often compressed and minified to optimize loading speed and performance. However, this compression makes it difficult to trace error locations (such as line and column numbers) in the original source code, increasing debugging difficulty. `SourceMap` files solve this problem:

- **Mapping Minified Code to Source Code**: `SourceMaps` record the mapping relationship between compressed code and original code, allowing developers to view uncompressed source code during debugging.
- **Precise Error Location**: Through `SourceMaps`, you can directly locate specific positions in the original source code when tracking errors, not just in the compressed files.
- **Improved Debugging Efficiency**: Developers don't need to manually decode compressed files, saving time in troubleshooting.

## How to Generate and Upload SourceMaps?

### Generating SourceMaps

Most modern build tools (such as Webpack, Rollup, or Vite) support generating `SourceMaps`. Here's an example configuration using Webpack:

1. Enable `SourceMap` generation in `webpack.config.js`:

```javascript
module.exports = {
  mode: "production",
  devtool: "source-map", // Generate separate .map files
  output: {
    filename: "bundle.js",
    path: path.resolve(__dirname, "dist"),
  },
};
```

2. After building, the `dist` directory will contain `bundle.js` and its corresponding `bundle.js.map` file.

### Uploading SourceMaps Using Flashduty CLI

Flashduty CLI provides the `sourcemaps` command for uploading `sourcemap` files to the Flashduty server. Here are the specific steps:

1. **Install Flashduty CLI**

   Ensure Node.js is installed, then install `flashcat-cli` via npm:

   ```bash
   npm install -g @flashcat/flashcat-cli
   ```

2. **Configure API Key and Service Information**
   ![2025-05-15-17-34-06](https://docs-cdn.flashcat.cloud/imges/png/026bb83be5f7ba043118e877f6bc2a82.png)
   In the **Application Management - Source Management** menu, click the "Upload Source" panel, fill in the following information, and generate an upload script:

   - **API Key**: Used to authenticate your identity (e.g., `test2`).
   - **Service Name**: The service name of your application (e.g., `my-service`).
   - **Version Number**: The release version of your application (e.g., `1.0.0`).
   - **Minified File Prefix**: The path prefix for compressed files (e.g., `/assets`).

   Example generated script:

   ```bash
   flashcat-cli sourcemaps upload \
     --service my-service \
     --release-version 1.0.0 \
     --minified-path-prefix /assets \
     --api-key test2
   ```

3. **Execute Upload**

   Run the generated script in your project root directory, ensuring the `sourcemap` files are located in the specified path (such as the `dist` directory). Flashduty CLI will upload the `sourcemap` files to the server.

   ```bash
   flashcat-cli sourcemaps upload --service my-service --release-version 1.0.0 --minified-path-prefix /assets --api-key test2 ./dist
   ```

   **Note**:

   - Ensure the `minified-path-prefix` matches the actual deployed path of your compressed files.
   - After successful upload, you can view the uploaded `sourcemap` files in **Application Management - Source Management**.

## How to Manage SourceMaps?

On the Flashduty platform, `sourcemap` files are managed through the **Application Management - Source Management** menu:

- **View Uploaded SourceMaps**: The menu lists all uploaded `sourcemap` files, including file paths, service names, version numbers, sizes, and upload times.
- **Version Management**: Through the `service` and `release-version` parameters, you can manage `sourcemaps` for different versions of your application, facilitating parallel debugging across multiple versions.
- **Permission Control**: Through the `API Key`, only authorized users can upload or manage `sourcemaps`.

## How to View Source Code in the Error Tracking Module?

Flashduty RUM (Real User Monitoring) integrates `sourcemap` functionality, supporting direct viewing of original source code in the error tracking module for precise issue location. Here's the workflow:

1. **Capture Frontend Errors**

   Flashduty RUM SDK automatically captures frontend errors (such as JavaScript exceptions, Promise rejections, network errors, etc.) and sends error stack information to the server.

   Example: Automatically capture unhandled exceptions

   ```javascript
   throw new Error("Something went wrong");
   ```

2. **Associate SourceMaps**

   When the file paths and line numbers in the error stack match with uploaded `sourcemaps`, Flashduty automatically maps the error location in compressed code to the original source code.

   For example, an error stack from compressed file `/assets/index-5e0391ac.js`:

   ```
   Error: Something went wrong
       at Object.<anonymous> (/assets/index-5e0391ac.js:1:123)
   ```

   Through `sourcemap`, mapped to original source code `src/components/App.js`:

   ```
   Error: Something went wrong
       at App.render (src/components/App.js:45:10)
   ```

3. **View Error Details**

   In the Flashduty error tracking module, click on a specific error record to view the following information:

   - **Error Message**: Such as `Something went wrong`.
   - **Original Stack**: Mapped source code file paths, line numbers, and column numbers (e.g., `src/components/App.js:45:10`).
   - **Context Code**: Displays source code snippets around the error location, facilitating quick problem identification.

4. **Debug and Fix**

   Based on the mapped source code location, developers can directly find the corresponding code in their local development environment, analyze the root cause, and fix the issue.

## Best Practices

1. **Standardize SourceMap Upload**:

   - Integrate the `flashcat-cli sourcemaps upload` command into your CI/CD pipeline to ensure automatic upload of `sourcemaps` with each release.
   - Example (GitHub Actions):
     ```yaml
     - name: Upload SourceMaps
       run: flashcat-cli sourcemaps upload --service my-service --release-version ${{ github.sha }} --minified-path-prefix /assets --api-key ${{ secrets.FLASHCAT_API_KEY }} ./dist
     ```

2. **Version Management**:

   - Use the `--release-version` parameter consistent with your application version number for easier tracking of specific `sourcemap` versions.

3. **Clean Source Code**:

   - Delete `sourcemap` files before uploading resources to CDN to avoid including source code information in the production environment.

4. **Test Mapping Effect**:
   - After uploading `sourcemaps`, proactively throw test errors to verify if the error tracking module can correctly map to source code.

## Common Issues

### 1. Why isn't the error stack mapping to source code?

- Confirm that `sourcemaps` were successfully uploaded and that the `minified-path-prefix` matches the actual deployment path.
- Check if the `service` and `release-version` match the application version when the error occurred.

### 2. How to prevent SourceMaps from leaking sensitive information?

- Ensure `sourcemap` files are only uploaded to the Flashduty server and not directly exposed on the public internet.
- In production environments, remove direct access to `sourcemap` files (e.g., through Nginx configuration).

### 3. What if uploading SourceMaps fails?

- Check if the `API Key` is valid.
- Ensure network connection is normal and the CLI version is up-to-date.
