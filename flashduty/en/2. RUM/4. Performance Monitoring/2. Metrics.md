## Overview

Flashduty RUM supports collecting and reporting Web Vitals-related performance metrics to help you comprehensively monitor and optimize website performance. Through these metrics, you can understand the actual experience of users when visiting your website and make targeted optimizations.

### Web Vitals Metrics Overview

Flashduty RUM supports the following [Core Web Vitals metrics](https://web.dev/articles/vitals):

- **Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)**: Measures the loading performance of the main content
- **Interaction to Next Paint (INP)**: Measures overall interaction responsiveness
- **Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)**: Measures visual stability
- **First Contentful Paint (FCP)**: Measures the time of first content rendering

In addition to core metrics, it also supports other auxiliary metrics:

- **First Input Delay (FID)**: Measures page interactivity
- **Time to First Byte (TTFB)**: Measures server response speed

These metrics are automatically collected when users visit pages and reported to the Flashduty platform through the SDK. You can view detailed performance data in the analysis dashboard.

Interaction to Next Paint and Largest Contentful Paint are not collected for pages opened in the background (for example, in a new tab or a window without focus).

## Metric Calculation Methods

### 1. Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)

- **Calculation**: The time from page load start (`navigationStart`) to the rendering completion of the largest visible content element (such as images, text blocks).
- **Use case**: Monitor loading speed of homepages or key pages, identify resource loading bottlenecks.

### 2. First Contentful Paint (FCP)

- **Calculation**: Measures the time from when a user first navigates to a page until any part of the page's content is rendered on the screen.
- **Use case**: Used to measure perceived loading speed, helps reassure users that something is happening.

### 3. Interaction to Next Paint (INP)

- **Calculation**: Measures the delay time from all user interactions (clicks, taps, keyboard inputs) to the next frame rendering.
- **Use case**: Evaluate overall interaction responsiveness of the page, optimize high-latency interaction scenarios.

### 4. Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)

- **Calculation**: Calculates the score of all unexpected layout shifts (shift distance × impact area).
- **Use case**: Identify page jumps caused by dynamic content or advertisements.

### 5. First Input Delay (FID)

- **Calculation**: The time difference from the user's first interaction to when the browser processes the event.
- **Use case**: Optimize response speed for interaction-intensive pages (such as forms, navigation menus).

## Monitoring Single Page Applications (SPA)

For Single Page Applications (SPA), the RUM browser SDK distinguishes between two navigation types through the `loading_type` attribute: `initial_load` and `route_change`.

1. History Single Page Applications
   If an interaction on a webpage causes the URL to change but the page does not refresh completely, the RUM SDK will start a new `view` using `loading_type:route_change`. RUM uses the [History API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/History) to track URL changes.

2. Hash Single Page Applications
   The RUM SDK automatically monitors frameworks that rely on hash (`#`) navigation. The SDK listens for `HashChangeEvent` and issues a new `view`. Events from HTML anchors that do not affect the current view context are ignored.

For SPA applications, if you need to monitor performance after route changes, it is recommended to use the [Custom Performance Monitoring](#Custom%20Performance%20Monitoring) feature to measure performance metrics of specific components or interactions.

## Custom Performance Monitoring

### 1. Component-level Performance Measurement

Use the `customVital` API to monitor the performance of specific components or interactions, suitable for:

- Critical component rendering time.
- User interaction response time.
- Business process duration.

#### Example: Measuring Component Rendering

```javascript
// Start timing
const ref = window.FC_RUM.startDurationVital("componentRendering", {
  description: "login-form",
  context: { clientId: "xxx", componentVersion: "1.0.0" },
});

// End timing
window.FC_RUM.stopDurationVital(ref);
```

#### Example: Directly Report Duration

```javascript
window.FC_RUM.addDurationVital("dropdownRendering", {
  startTime: 1707755888000, // UNIX timestamp (milliseconds)
  duration: 10000, // Duration (milliseconds)
});
```

### 2. Performance Timestamp Recording

Use the `addTiming` API to record key timestamps, suitable for:

- Loading of critical elements (such as first-screen images).
- User's first interaction (such as first scroll).
- Business node timestamps.

#### Example: Recording First Scroll

```javascript
document.addEventListener("scroll", function handler() {
  document.removeEventListener("scroll", handler);
  window.FC_RUM.addTiming("first_scroll");
});
```

#### Example: Asynchronous Scenario

```javascript
document.addEventListener("scroll", function handler() {
  document.removeEventListener("scroll", handler);
  const timing = Date.now();
  window.FC_RUM.onReady(() => {
    window.FC_RUM.addTiming("first_scroll", timing);
  });
});
```

## Considerations

### 1. Naming Conventions

- Avoid spaces and special characters in metric names.
- Use descriptive naming (such as `login_form_render`).
- Maintain naming consistency.

### 2. Performance Impact Control

- Control the number of custom metrics.
- Avoid frequent timing.
- Set sampling rates reasonably.

## Common Issues

### 1. Abnormal Page Loading Time

- Check slowly loading resources (images, scripts).
- Investigate third-party script blocking.
- Analyze long-running JavaScript.

### 2. Inaccurate Activity Status Determination

- Confirm whether there are frequent background requests.
- Check the handling of long connections or streaming requests.
- Use `excludedActivityUrls` to exclude interference.

### 3. Custom Metrics Issues

- Verify that metric names comply with conventions.
- Ensure timers are started and stopped correctly.
- Check timestamp accuracy in asynchronous scenarios.

### 4. Empty Web Vitals Metrics Collection

- **Background pages**: Pages opened in new tabs or unfocused windows, causing INP and LCP to be uncollectable
- **SPA route changes**: During `loading_type:route_change`, Core Web Vitals metrics (LCP, CLS, INP, FCP) will not be re-collected
- **Integration method**: Page loads completely before SDK is fully initialized
- **Page lifecycle**: Page is closed or navigated away before metrics collection is complete
- **Browser compatibility**: Older browser versions do not support certain Web Vitals APIs
- **Empty page content**: Page has no measurable content elements (such as blank pages)
