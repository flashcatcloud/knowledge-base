## Overview

Flashduty RUM Session Explorer provides powerful search capabilities, allowing you to quickly locate and analyze RUM data through flexible query syntax. Queries consist of **terms** and **operators**, supporting complex search condition combinations to help you accurately find the information you need from massive data.

The query supports two types of terms:

1. **Single term**: A single word, such as `test` or `hello`
2. **Phrase**: A group of words surrounded by double quotes, such as `"hello flashduty"`

You can use the following boolean operators to combine multiple terms to build complex queries:

| Operator | Description                                                         | Example              |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------- |
| `AND`    | Intersection: both terms must be in the selected view (default)     | `error AND timeout`  |
| `OR`     | Union: either term is contained in the selected view, must use `()` | `(error OR warning)` |
| `-`      | Exclusion: the following term is not in the view                    | `error -timeout`     |

## Full-Text Search

Full-text search is only supported for some fields. If no results are found, please switch to field queries.

You can quickly query data through full-text search:

| Query Statement | Description                                       |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| hello           | Exact match for fields containing `hello`         |
| hello\*         | Match fields starting with `hello`                |
| \*hello         | Match fields ending with `hello`                  |
| \*hello\*       | Match fields containing `hello`                   |
| "hello world"   | Exact match for fields containing `"hello world"` |

## Escaping Special Characters and Spaces

When searching for field values containing special characters, you need to use backslash `\` escaping or double quotes. The following characters are considered special: `:`, `"`, `*`, `-`, `>`, `<`, `,`, `(`, `)`, `[`, `]`, `\` and space.

## Attribute Search

You can use `attribute:term` to search for specific attributes:

| Query Statement         | Description                                   |
| :---------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| browser_name:Chrome     | Search for browsers with value `Chrome`       |
| view_name:\*/detail     | Search for view names ending with `/detail`   |
| -resource_status_code:0 | Search for resources with status code not `0` |
| os_name:"Mac OS X"      | Search for OS name with value `"Mac OS X"`    |

## Numeric Search

For numeric type attributes, we can use comparison operators `>` `>=` `<` `<=` for searching:

| Query Statement             | Description                                             |
| :-------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| session_error_count:>5      | Search for sessions with error count greater than `5`   |
| view_time_spent:>=1.00min   | Search for views with time spent greater than `1min`    |
| session_view_count:[2 TO 8] | Search for sessions with view count between `2` and `8` |

## Complex Search

For complex situations, we can combine any conditions for searching.

### Error Analysis Search

```
error_message:Warning\:* view_url_path:/wallet/*
```

Search for Warning type errors occurring on wallet pages.

### Performance Analysis Search

```
view_loading_time:>=5s view_url_path:/incident/detail/*
```

Search for views with loading time exceeding 5 seconds and starting with `/incident/detail/`.

### Failed Request Analysis

```
-resource_status_code:200 resource_type:(fetch OR xhr)
```

Search for resources with request type `fetch` or `xhr` and status code not `200`.

### Page Behavior Analysis

```
view_url_path:/incident (view_action_count:>=2 OR view_error_count:>=3)
```

Search for views with URL `/incident` and action count greater than `2` or error count greater than `3`.

## Advanced Search Tips

### 1. Time Range Search

Combine time ranges for precise searching:

```
view_loading_time:>2s client_time:>1758253826081
```

### 2. User Behavior Search

```
action_type:click view_url_path:/checkout/*
```

Search for user click behaviors on checkout pages.

### 3. Device Type Search

```
device_type:mobile view_loading_time:>3s
```

Search for views on mobile devices with loading time exceeding 3 seconds.

### 4. Geographic Location Search

```
geo_country:China session_error_count:>0
```

Search for sessions with errors in China.

## Best Practices

1. **Use quotes for phrases**: Ensure exact matching of multi-word phrases
2. **Use wildcards reasonably**: Avoid overly broad search conditions
3. **Combine multiple conditions**: Build precise queries through AND/OR operators
4. **Save common searches**: Improve efficiency of repeated queries
5. **Utilize auto-completion**: Reduce input errors and improve search accuracy
