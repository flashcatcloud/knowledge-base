## Overview

In error tracking, all issues have a status that helps you categorize and prioritize problems. Flashduty supports four issue statuses:

- **For Review (for_review)**: New or recurring issues that need attention.
- **In Progress (reviewed)**: Issues that have been classified and need to be fixed, either immediately or later.
- **Ignored (ignored)**: Issues that don't require further investigation or handling.
- **Resolved (resolved)**: Issues that have been fixed and no longer occur.

All newly discovered issues have an initial status of **For Review (for_review)**. Flashduty automatically updates statuses based on specific conditions, and you can also manually adjust issue statuses.

## Automatic Issue Resolution

Flashduty automatically marks inactive or resolved issues as **Resolved (resolved)** based on the following rules:

- If the last reported version of an issue is more than 14 days old and the error hasn't appeared in newer versions, the system will automatically resolve it. To ensure automatic resolution works correctly, please configure version tags for your services.
- If no `version` tag is set, the system will automatically resolve an issue when it hasn't had any new error reports in the past 14 days.

:::tip
Properly configuring your application's `version` tag is crucial for accurately identifying resolved issues.

## Automatic Issue Reopening

Flashduty has issue detection capability. When a previously resolved issue appears again, the system automatically reopens it and marks it as **For Review (for_review)**, while recording the event as "Regression" in the activity timeline.

### What is Regression?

Regression refers to previously fixed issues unexpectedly reappearing after code updates. Flashduty's regression detection automatically identifies these situations, reopening the relevant issues rather than creating duplicate issues, thereby preserving the complete context and history of the problem.

### Regression Detection Mechanism

Regression detection is triggered when either of the following conditions is met:

- If a **Resolved (resolved)** error reappears in an updated version of the code, the system triggers regression detection
- If a **Resolved (resolved)** error reappears when no version tag has been set

Once regression is detected, Flashduty will:

1. Automatically change the issue status to **For Review (for_review)**
2. Add a **Regression** label to the issue for easy identification

### Regression Version Association

Regression detection considers the service version information where the error occurred, triggering detection only in new versions after the issue was marked as **Resolved (resolved)**. To ensure this feature works correctly, be sure to configure a `version` tag for your service.

```javascript
window.FLASHCAT_RUM.init({
  applicationId: "rum-application-id",
  environment: "production",
  version: "1.0.0", // Make sure to set the correct version number
});
```

:::tip
If you don't set a version tag, the system will still mark recurring resolved issues as "Regression", but it cannot determine if they occurred in a new version.

## Manually Updating Issue Status

You can manually update an issue's status anywhere issues are displayed, including issue lists or detail panels. Simply click on the current status and select a new status from the dropdown menu.

## Status Management Best Practices

- **Continuous Monitoring**: Regularly check issues with **For Review (for_review)** status to ensure new and recurring problems are addressed promptly.
- **Version Management**: Always configure correct version tags for your applications so the system can accurately identify resolved issues.

By effectively managing issue statuses, your team can focus on solving important problems, reduce time spent handling noise, and improve overall development efficiency.
