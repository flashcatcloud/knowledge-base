## Overview

Flashduty RUM's **Session Replay** feature is a powerful user behavior analysis tool designed to help developers understand user experience and quickly identify root causes by reproducing user operation paths in websites or applications, combined with RUM performance and error tracking data.

## Core Features

1. **User Operation Recording**: Automatically records user actions such as mouse clicks, page scrolling, form inputs, navigation behaviors, etc., generating intuitive session replay videos.
2. **Error Correlation**: Combines session replay with error tracking, automatically correlating user operations and page states when errors occur, helping to quickly identify problem trigger scenarios.
3. **Interaction Analysis**: Provides user interaction timeline, displaying user operation sequences, page loading times, and occurrence points of key events (such as errors or network request failures).
4. **Privacy Protection**: Offers flexible privacy configurations to mask sensitive information (such as form input content) or limit recording scope, ensuring data compliance.

## Value and Benefits

1. **Intuitive Problem Identification**: Quickly understand specific operation paths when users encounter issues through visual replay, reducing troubleshooting time.
2. **Enhanced User Experience**: Gain insights into user behavior patterns, discover interaction pain points, and optimize page design and functional logic.
3. **Data-Driven Optimization**: Combine error data and user behavior analysis to provide reliable data support for product iterations.

## Use Cases

1. **Problem Reproduction**: Reproduce operation scenarios when errors occur by replaying user sessions, quickly identifying problem root causes.
2. **User Behavior Analysis**: Analyze user behavior on key pages (such as payment, registration) to optimize user experience and conversion rates.
3. **Debugging and Optimization**: Combine error tracking to identify issues like slow page loading and interaction lag, optimizing frontend performance.
4. **Customer Support**: Quickly understand user-reported issues by replaying user sessions, providing more precise support.

## Session Replay Process

Flashduty RUM's session replay functionality is divided into two key phases: **Behavior Recording and Replay**, **Problem Analysis and Optimization**.

### 1. Behavior Recording and Replay

Quickly recording user behavior and generating replays is the first step in analysis. During the recording phase, the recording SDK takes snapshots of the current DOM and CSS styles, and collects corresponding events when user behaviors occur (DOM changes, mouse movements, clicks, form inputs, etc.). Data is reported after serialization, compression, and removal of sensitive information.

### 2. Problem Analysis and Optimization

Flashduty RUM provides rich behavior data and analysis tools to help identify problems and optimize experience:

#### Core Behavior Data

- **User Interactions**: Timeline of operations such as clicks, scrolling, input, navigation, etc.
- **Page Performance**: Page loading times, resource loading failures, API call delays, etc.
- **Error Context**: Page state, DOM structure, and user operations when errors occur.

#### Context Information

- **User Environment**: Browser, device, operating system, network conditions.
- **Operation Path**: Complete operation sequence of users during the session.
- **Page Snapshots**: Page DOM snapshots when errors occur.

Through Flashduty RUM's visual replay tools, you can quickly analyze the correlation between user behavior and problems:

| Problem Type                | Typical Manifestation              | Possible Causes                             | Identification Method                 |
| --------------------------- | ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| **Slow Page Loading**       | Page white screen, loading timeout | Resource loading failure, network delay     | Check for resource loading exceptions |
| **Function Failure**        | Button clicks unresponsive         | Code logic errors, event binding issues     | View specific behavior and exceptions |
| **Form Submission Failure** | Data not saved, submission failure | API response errors, form validation issues | View error and exception details      |

## Problem Analysis Tools

#### 1. Session Replay Panel

In the player, you can view all user operations including clicks, scrolling, and inputs, supporting playback controls such as fast-forward, replay, and seek, helping developers intuitively reproduce problem scenarios and precisely analyze user behavior.

#### 2. Event and Context Correlation

Session replay supports correlation with various events (such as view loading, errors, user behavior), allowing detailed viewing of errors and attributes (context information such as device type, browser version, geographic location, etc.), facilitating root cause identification and in-depth analysis.
