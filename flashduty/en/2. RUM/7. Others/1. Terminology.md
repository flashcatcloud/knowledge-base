## Terminology

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| RUM (Real User Monitoring) | RUM collects and analyzes performance data from real users as they use websites or applications, helping developers understand actual user experiences and optimize application performance |
| Action | Used to analyze user behavior, measure interaction performance and frustration points (such as "rage clicks") in the user experience |
| View | Views record page load times, resource requests, etc., core to performance monitoring |
| Error | Used to monitor frontend stability, identifying errors that affect user experience |
| Resource | Analyzes resource loading time and performance, optimizing page loading speed |
| Long Task | RUM captures long tasks to identify performance bottlenecks that cause page stuttering or poor user experience |
| Session | Sessions are the core unit of RUM data aggregation, used to analyze user journeys and experiences |
| Pageview | Pageviews are the basic unit of RUM data, used to analyze the performance of specific pages |
| Issue | Issues are core to error management, used to aggregate similar errors, prioritize problems, and help developers quickly locate and fix problems by combining context (such as stack traces, session replays) |
| Core Web Vitals | RUM monitors these metrics to evaluate web page loading and interaction performance |
| LCP (Largest Contentful Paint) | Measures page loading performance, recording the time when the main content of the page finishes loading |
| FID (First Input Delay) | Measures page interaction performance, recording the delay between when a user first interacts with the page and when the browser responds |
| CLS (Cumulative Layout Shift) | Measures page visual stability, recording unexpected layout shifts that occur during page loading |
| TTFB (Time to First Byte) | Measures server response speed, recording the time from when a request is sent until the first byte is received |
| Facet | Facilitates building queries in the RUM Explorer, analyzing the behavior of specific user groups |
| Attribute | Provides context, enhancing the flexibility of data analysis |
| Global Context | Enhances the customization capability of RUM data analysis |
