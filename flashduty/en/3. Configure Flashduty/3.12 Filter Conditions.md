Filter conditions in Flashduty are used to match different alerts, incidents, or events. Through filter conditions, we can screen specific objects for further operations. This article introduces the design and configuration methods of filter conditions.

## Where Are Filter Conditions Used?
---

Filter conditions are applied in the following scenarios:

1. **Escalation Rules**: Multiple escalation rules can be created within the same channel, each with different filter conditions. You can set different responders for different incidents.
2. **Silence Rules**: Set filter conditions to match specific incidents, and matched incidents will be silenced.
3. **Inhibit Rules**: Set filter conditions to match both newly triggered incidents and existing active incidents. When new incidents meet the conditions, they will be inhibited.
4. **Alert Grouping**: Alert grouping supports default grouping dimensions, but when you need fine-grained control, you can set filter conditions to match specific alerts and set new grouping dimensions for these incidents.
5. **Routing Rules**: When using alert integration in the integration center, you can set global routing matching rules. Use different filter conditions to match different alerts and route them to specific channels.
6. **Label Enhancement**: Set filter conditions to match specific alerts, and generate labels according to rules for alerts that meet the conditions.

## How to Configure Filter Conditions?

### Rule Design

Flashduty has abstracted the entire filter condition system, aiming to achieve minimal configuration while meeting most scenario requirements.

The overall judgment logic is divided into multiple groups of conditions:
- Conditions within a group have an **`and`** relationship, meaning all conditions must match for the group to match.
- Groups have an **`or`** relationship with each other, meaning if any group matches, the overall condition matches.

Each condition consists of a field, operator (oper), and target values. There are only two types of operators:
- **`Match`**: There can be multiple values, and if any value matches, the condition is satisfied.
- **`Not Match`**: There can be multiple values, and if none of the values match, the condition is satisfied.

:::tip
The target values in conditions are all strings. They support multiple matching methods including **exact**, **regex**, **wildcard**, **CIDR matching**, and **numeric comparison**.

As shown above, we have two groups of conditions, each with two conditions and multiple matching values. If the severity is "Critical" or "Warning" AND the check label equals "Binlog Sync Delay", the overall condition is satisfied. Alternatively, if the check label contains any of "cpu", "io", or "disk" AND the value label is greater than 90, the overall condition is also satisfied. We can also describe the filter conditions with an intuitive expression:

```
( severity == Critical|Warning && labels.check == Binlog Sync Delay )
or
( labels.check == /cpu/|/io/|/disk/ && labels.value == num:gt:90 )
```

### Regex Filtering

When a value string is prefixed and suffixed with `/`, the entire value will be treated as a `regex`. The target value must match this regex to be considered a match.

Example:
- labels.check: /down/, matches when the check label contains "down".

:::tip
Flashduty uses the `RE2` regex standard platform-wide. Some `Perl` syntax may not work. You can use AI Chatbot to generate expressions and verify them at [RE2 Playground](https://re2js.leopard.in.ua/).

### Wildcard Filtering

When a value string contains `*` or `?` without `/` prefix/suffix, it will be treated as a `wildcard`. Currently, only `*` and `?` are supported, where `*` matches zero or more characters, and `?` matches any single character. The target value must match this wildcard string to be considered a match.

Example:
- labels.check: down*, matches when the check label starts with "down".

:::tip
You can use `*` to check if a field `Exists` or `NotExists`.

If a field `matches *`, it means the field must exist. If a field `does not match *`, it means the field must not exist.
:::

### CIDR Matching

When a value is prefixed with `cidr`, the entire value will be treated as an `IP range`.

Example:
- labels.host: cidr:10.0.0.206/24, matches when the IP label is within the "10.0.0.206/24" range.

### Numeric Comparison

When a value is prefixed with `num:[gt|ge|lt|le]:`, it will be treated as a `numeric comparison`. The comparison rules are:
- **gt**: greater than
- **ge**: greater than or equal to
- **lt**: less than
- **le**: less than or equal to

Example:
- labels.value: num:ge:90, matches when the value label is greater than or equal to 90.

### Exact Value Filtering

When a value doesn't match any of the above formats, it will be treated as an `exact match`. Only when the strings are exactly equal will it be considered a match.

## FAQ

<details>
  <summary>Why doesn't the system suggest available labels?</summary>
  Flashduty receives large amounts of data, and to ensure system stability, it only searches for and deduplicates labels from up to 500 alert events within the past 24 hours. Therefore, the available labels may change dynamically, and no labels may be available if there's no new data in the past 24 hours.

  In this case, **you can manually enter labels**.
