FlashDuty, as a unified alert management platform, does not generate alert data by itself. It requires integration with third-party monitoring platforms to achieve unified alert reception, noise reduction, assignment, notification, resolution, analysis, and automation. This includes platforms like N9E/FlashCat, Zabbix, Prometheus, and various cloud providers' alert systems. For more integration types, please refer to [Alert Integration](https://docs.flashcat.cloud/en/flashduty/custom-alert-integration-guide).

## Integration Methods
---

### Private Integration
Access path for Private Integration: **Channel Details => Integrations => Private Integration**.
- Private Integrations can be added when creating a channel or within an existing channel.
- Alerts received through Private Integrations **do not require routing rules, as all alerts are distributed to that channel** (excluding filtered alerts) and cannot be shared with other channels.
- Choose Private Integration when alerts don't need to be distributed to multiple channels.

### Shared Integration
Access path for shared integration: **Integration Center => Alert Events**.
- Alert event types created in the Integration Center are global and **must use routing rules to direct alerts to one or multiple channels**.
- Each integration **must be configured with at least one receiving channel, otherwise the integration will not be effective and cannot receive alert events**.

:::tip

- Both dedicated and shared integrations generate a push URL after creation. Copy this URL to the corresponding platform to complete the integration.
- Each alert source integration has different data types. For specific integration methods, refer to the [Integration Guide](https://docs.flashcat.cloud/en/flashduty/custom-alert-integration-guide).

:::

:::caution
To ensure system stability, we limit the frequency of event requests for each integration. Currently, the limits are 100 requests per second (QPS) and 1000 requests per minute (QPM) per integration.

If your requests exceed these limits, you will receive a 429 status code response. In such cases, wait for a while before retrying.

These limits may be adjusted in the future. Please contact us if you need higher limits.
