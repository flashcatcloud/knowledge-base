## Configure Alert Grouping
---
Go to `Channel Details` - `Noise reduction` to set up **alert grouping** policies. When creating a new channel, alert grouping is disabled by default. We recommend enabling it manually and configuring grouping strategies as needed.

:::tip
When alert grouping is disabled, each alert will create a separate incident with identical basic information.
:::

### General Configuration

- Grouping Window: You can choose to only group alerts that occur close together (stronger correlation). Alerts outside the time window will trigger new incidents. Note that this is a sliding window that extends as new alerts are merged.
- Storm Warning: After an incident is triggered, the system will immediately assign and notify (assuming you haven't set notification delays). Subsequently merged alerts won't trigger new notifications, which could prevent you from detecting alert storms. Therefore, we provide this threshold - when the number of merged alerts reaches the threshold, the system will trigger a storm warning to remind you to handle it urgently.
- Strict Grouping: When enabled, grouping conditions where both alert and incident values are empty will be treated as different items; when disabled, they will be treated as equal items (not supported in intelligent grouping).
- Preview: You can use the preview function to fetch recent events and render noise reduction results in real-time to evaluate effectiveness.

### Intelligent Grouping

- Intelligent Grouping: When a newly triggered alert is highly similar to an active incident's content, the alert will be merged into the incident.

### Rule-based Grouping

- Unified Control: All new alerts in the channel use the same dimensions for grouping. Supports selecting multiple attributes and labels, with conditions matching only when all attributes and labels are identical.

- Fine-grained Control: New alerts are grouped by matching conditions dimensions. If no match is found, default dimensions are used. If no default dimensions are set, no grouping occurs.

## Grouping Example
---

With a channel configured to group by **alert check item**, the system receives 5 alert notifications that trigger alerts and incidents in sequence:

```
Incident: cpu idle < 20% / es.nj.03, Critical

  - Alert cpu idle < 20% / es.nj.03:
      - Event 1: es.nj.03, cpu.idle = 10%, Critical
      - Event 2: es.nj.03, cpu.idle = 18%, Warning
      - Event 4: es.nj.03, cpu.idle = 10%, Ok

  - Alert cpu idle < 20% / es.nj.01:
      - Event 3: es.nj.01, cpu.idle = 15%, Warning
  
  - Alert cpu idle < 20% / es.nj.02:
      - Event 5: es.nj.02, cpu.idle = 19%, Warning
```

Through the console's incident details page, we can see the final [Incident-Alert-Event] relationships:
- Click the alert title to view associated alert details, including timeline and related events
- Click event points to view specific event content, including labels and descriptions

## FAQ
---
<details>
  <summary>Does the incident title change when new alerts are grouped?</summary>
  No, by default, the incident title remains identical to the first alert that triggered it. You can manually modify the incident title at any time, and it won't change as new alerts are grouped.
</details>
<details>
  <summary>Do incident labels change when new alerts are grouped?</summary>
  
  - Manually created alerts: No, their label list will always remain empty
  - Automatically triggered alerts: Possibly. The incident labels will match the labels of the first alert that triggered it, and if the alert labels change, the incident labels will update accordingly.
</details>
<details>
  <summary>Do alert labels change when new events are grouped?</summary>
  Yes, alert labels always stay consistent with newly grouped events. For example, if you receive a "CPU idle too low" alert at 10:00 with a trigger value of 10%, this trigger value label may change dynamically as more events are grouped. However, if a new recovery event is received, the alert will maintain its existing labels and only add previously non-existent labels. Our principle is to maintain alert labels as close as possible to their trigger state.
</details>
<details>
  <summary>Is there a limit to the number of alerts that can be grouped into an incident?</summary>
  Yes, we limit each incident to grouping a maximum of 1000 alerts, primarily to reduce console page rendering time. However, as Flashduty is a high-performance event processing system with extensive backend concurrency logic, it's normal to occasionally see incidents with more than 1000 grouped alerts.
</details>
<details>
  <summary>Is there a limit to the number of events that can be grouped into an alert?</summary>
  No, but an alert's event grouping window is limited to 24 hours. This means if an alert hasn't recovered after 24 hours, no new events will be grouped into it. New events received by Flashduty will generate new alerts.
</details>
<details>
  <summary>Why doesn't the number of events I pushed match the number of events associated with the alert?</summary>
  Event-to-alert merging is also a noise reduction process. If Flashduty determines that a newly reported event doesn't significantly differ from the alert (e.g., no changes in status, severity, description, etc.), Flashduty will discard the new event and use its labels to override existing ones.
