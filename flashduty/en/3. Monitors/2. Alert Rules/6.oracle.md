This document provides detailed instructions on configuring alert rules for Oracle data sources in Monitors. Monitors supports using standard SQL syntax to query Oracle and trigger alerts based on query results.

## Core concepts

- **Query language**: Uses Oracle SQL syntax.
- **Field handling**: The alert engine automatically converts all field names in query results to **lowercase**. When configuring value fields and label fields, always use lowercase letters.
- **Time handling**: It's recommended to use functions like `SYSDATE`, `SYSTIMESTAMP` in SQL for time range filtering.

## 1. Threshold mode

This mode is suitable for scenarios requiring threshold comparisons on aggregated values.

### Configuration

1. **Query**: Write a SQL aggregation query that returns numeric columns and (optional) label columns.
  - Example: Count error logs per service in the last 5 minutes.
    ```sql
    SELECT 
        service_name, 
        count(*) AS error_cnt 
    FROM app_log 
    WHERE log_time > SYSDATE - INTERVAL '5' MINUTE AND level = 'error'
    GROUP BY service_name
    ```
2. **Field mapping**:
  - **Label fields**: Fields used to distinguish different alert objects. In the example above, this is `service_name`. This field can be left empty, and Monitors will automatically treat all fields except value fields as label fields.
  - **Value fields**: Numeric fields used for threshold evaluation. In the example above, this is `error_cnt`.
3. **Threshold conditions**:
  - Use `$A.field_name` to reference values.
  - Example: `Critical: $A.error_cnt > 50`, `Warning: $A.error_cnt > 10`.

### How it works

The engine executes the SQL query and retrieves the result set. It groups data by label fields, then extracts value field values for comparison against threshold expressions.

### Recovery logic

- **Auto recovery**: When the latest SQL query result shows that a data group's value no longer meets any alert threshold, a recovery event is automatically generated.
- **Specific recovery conditions**: Configure additional recovery expressions (e.g., `$A.error_cnt < 5`).
- **Recovery query**:
  - Supports configuring an independent SQL statement for recovery evaluation.
  - Supports `${label_name}` variable substitution.
  - Example:
    ```sql
    SELECT network_host FROM network_status 
    WHERE check_time > SYSDATE - INTERVAL '5' MINUTE 
      AND network_host = '${network_host}' 
      AND interface = '${interface}' 
      AND status = 'UP'
    ```
    - The engine replaces `${network_host}` and `${interface}` with actual values before executing the query. If data is found, recovery is confirmed.

## 2. Data exists mode

This mode is suitable for scenarios where filtering logic is written directly in SQL.

### Configuration

1. **Query**: Use a `HAVING` clause in SQL to directly filter out anomalous data.
  - Example: Directly query services with more than 50 errors.
    ```sql
    SELECT 
        service_name, 
        count(*) AS error_cnt 
    FROM app_log 
    WHERE log_time > SYSDATE - INTERVAL '5' MINUTE AND level = 'error'
    GROUP BY service_name
    HAVING count(*) > 50
    ```
2. **Evaluation rule**: An alert is triggered as soon as the SQL query returns data.

### Pros and cons

- **Pros**: Leverages Oracle database computing power for filtering, reducing network transmission.
- **Cons**: Cannot distinguish between multiple severity levels.

### Recovery logic

- **Data disappearance means recovery**: Recovery is confirmed when the SQL query result is empty.
- **Recovery query**: Supports configuring additional query statements to assist in determining recovery status.

## 3. No data mode

This mode monitors scenarios where data is expected but actually missing.

### Configuration

1. **Query**: Write a SQL query that should continuously return data.
  - Example: Query heartbeat reports from all probes.
    ```sql
    SELECT probe_id, max(check_time) as last_seen
    FROM probe_heartbeat
    WHERE check_time > SYSDATE - INTERVAL '5' MINUTE
    GROUP BY probe_id
    ```
2. **Evaluation rule**: If a `probe_id` appeared in previous cycles but cannot be found in the current and N consecutive cycles, a "no data" alert is triggered.

## 4. Best practices and considerations

### Index optimization

Always include time range filtering in the `WHERE` clause and ensure there's an index on the time field. Otherwise, it may cause full table scans and affect database performance.

- Recommended: `log_time > SYSDATE - INTERVAL '5' MINUTE`.

### Field case sensitivity

Monitors engine converts column names returned by Oracle to lowercase.

- Configuration: Always use lowercase letters when filling in label fields and value fields.
