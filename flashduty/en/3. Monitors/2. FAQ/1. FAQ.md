1. **Alert rule execution does not meet expectations, how to debug?**
   - On the alert rules list page, there is a debug log switch. You can turn on this switch, after which the alert engine process (`monitedge`) will output detailed execution logs for this rule, making it convenient for you to troubleshoot issues.
   - `monitedge` outputs logs to standard output, i.e., `stdout`.
   - If `monitedge` is running via Docker, you can view log content through the `docker logs <container_id>` command.
   - If `monitedge` is running via Kubernetes, you can view log content through the `kubectl logs <pod_name>` command.
   - If `monitedge` is started via systemd (i.e., Linux installation mode), you can view log content through the `journalctl -u monitedge.service -f` command, or directly view the `/var/log/messages` file. `monitedge` follows cloud-native best practice recommendations by outputting logs to standard output and does not write logs to separate log files, facilitating log collection system gathering as well as rotation and compression.
