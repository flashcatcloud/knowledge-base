## What is Real User Monitoring?
---

Real User Monitoring (RUM) is a technology that allows you to track and analyze the actual experience of users interacting with your web applications. Unlike synthetic monitoring, which simulates user interactions, RUM collects data from real users' browsers, providing insights into how your application performs in the wild.

FlashCat RUM helps developers, DevOps engineers, and business stakeholders understand application performance, identify issues, and improve user experience by collecting and analyzing data directly from end-users' browsers.

### Key Features

1. **Performance Monitoring**: Track key performance metrics like page load time, resource loading, and JavaScript execution to identify bottlenecks affecting user experience.

2. **Error Tracking**: Automatically capture JavaScript errors, network failures, and other issues that impact users, with detailed context for faster debugging.

3. **User Journey Analysis**: Follow user paths through your application to understand behavior patterns, identify friction points, and optimize conversion flows.

4. **Session Replay**: Visualize user sessions to see exactly how users interact with your application and where they encounter problems.

5. **Resource Monitoring**: Analyze the performance of individual resources (images, scripts, API calls) to optimize loading times and reduce bandwidth usage.

## Why Choose FlashCat RUM?
---

1. **Complete Visibility**: Get a comprehensive view of your application's performance from the user's perspective, across different browsers, devices, and geographic locations.

2. **Proactive Issue Detection**: Identify and resolve problems before they impact a significant number of users, improving overall application reliability.

3. **Data-Driven Optimization**: Make informed decisions about performance improvements based on real user data rather than assumptions.

4. **Seamless Integration**: Easily integrate with your existing FlashCat monitoring stack for a unified view of your application's health and performance.

5. **Low Overhead**: Lightweight JavaScript SDK designed to have minimal impact on your application's performance while collecting valuable data.

## How RUM Works
---

FlashCat RUM works by injecting a lightweight JavaScript SDK into your web application. This SDK collects various types of data about user interactions and application performance:

1. **Page Views**: Information about page loads, navigation timing, and user context.

2. **Resources**: Details about the loading of resources like images, scripts, and API calls.

3. **User Actions**: Interactions like clicks, form submissions, and custom events.

4. **Errors**: JavaScript exceptions, network failures, and other issues.

5. **Long Tasks**: JavaScript execution that blocks the main thread for extended periods.

This data is sent to FlashCat's backend, where it's processed, analyzed, and presented in dashboards and reports that help you understand your application's performance and user experience.

## Getting Started
---

To start using FlashCat RUM, you need to:

1. Create a RUM application in the FlashCat console
2. Instrument your web application with the RUM SDK
3. Configure data collection settings
4. Explore the collected data in the RUM dashboard
