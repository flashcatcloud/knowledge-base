## Overview
---

The Flashduty RUM SDK generates events that have associated metrics and attributes. Every RUM event has a set of default attributes, such as the URL of the page (`view.url`) and user information like their device type (`device.type`) and their country (`geo.country`).

There are additional metrics and attributes specific to each event type. For example, the `view.loading_time` metric is associated with view events, and the `resource.method` attribute is associated with resource events.

## Event Types
---

| Event Type | Retention | Description |
|------------|-----------|-------------|
| Session | 30 days | A user session begins when a user starts browsing the web application. It contains high-level information about the user (browser, device, geo-location). It aggregates all RUM events collected during the user journey with a unique `session.id` attribute. Note: The session resets after 15 minutes of inactivity. |
| View | 30 days | A view event is generated each time a user visits a page of the web application. While the user remains on the same page, resource, long-task, error, and action events are linked to the related RUM view with the `view.id` attribute. |
| Resource | 15 days | A resource event is generated for images, XHR, Fetch, CSS, or JS libraries loaded on a webpage. It includes detailed loading timing information. |
| Long Task | 15 days | A long task event is generated for any task in the browser that blocks the main thread for more than 50ms. |
| Error | 30 days | RUM collects every frontend error emitted by the browser. |
| Action | 30 days | RUM action events track user interactions during a user journey and can also be manually sent to monitor custom user actions. |

The following diagram illustrates the RUM event hierarchy:

```
Session
  └── View 1
      ├── Resource 1
      ├── Resource 2
      ├── Error 1
      ├── Long Task 1
      └── Action 1
  └── View 2
      ├── Resource 3
      ├── Resource 4
      └── Action 2
```
