## Overview
---

Performance monitoring is a critical aspect of Real User Monitoring (RUM) that helps you understand how your web application performs for real users. FlashCat RUM collects various performance metrics that provide insights into page load times, resource loading, and JavaScript execution.

## Core Web Vitals
---

Core Web Vitals are a set of specific factors that Google considers important for user experience. FlashCat RUM automatically collects these metrics:

### Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)

LCP measures the time it takes for the largest content element visible in the viewport to be rendered. This could be an image, video, or block-level text element.

- **Good**: Less than 2.5 seconds
- **Needs Improvement**: Between 2.5 and 4 seconds
- **Poor**: More than 4 seconds

### First Input Delay (FID)

FID measures the time from when a user first interacts with your page (e.g., clicks a link, taps a button) to the time when the browser is able to respond to that interaction.

- **Good**: Less than 100 milliseconds
- **Needs Improvement**: Between 100 and 300 milliseconds
- **Poor**: More than 300 milliseconds

### Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)

CLS measures the sum of all unexpected layout shifts that occur during the entire lifespan of the page. A layout shift occurs when a visible element changes its position from one frame to the next.

- **Good**: Less than 0.1
- **Needs Improvement**: Between 0.1 and 0.25
- **Poor**: More than 0.25

## Additional Performance Metrics
---

In addition to Core Web Vitals, FlashCat RUM collects several other performance metrics:

### First Contentful Paint (FCP)

FCP measures the time from when the page starts loading to when any part of the page's content is rendered on the screen.

### DOM Interactive

DOM Interactive measures the time until the parser finishes its work on the main document and the HTML is parsed.

### DOM Content Loaded

DOM Content Loaded measures the time until the initial HTML document has been completely loaded and parsed, without waiting for stylesheets, images, and subframes to finish loading.

### DOM Complete

DOM Complete measures the time until the page and all of its subresources are ready.

### Load Event

Load Event measures the time until the load event is fired, indicating the page is fully loaded.

### Time to First Byte (TTFB)

TTFB measures the time from when the user navigates to a page until the first byte of the response is received.

## Performance Dashboard
---

The FlashCat RUM Performance Dashboard provides a comprehensive view of your application's performance metrics. To access the dashboard:

1. Log in to the FlashCat console
2. Navigate to **RUM** > **Applications** > **Your Application**
3. Click on the **Performance** tab

The dashboard includes:

- **Performance Overview**: A summary of key performance metrics over time
- **Core Web Vitals**: Detailed metrics for LCP, FID, and CLS
- **Page Load Timing**: Breakdown of the page load process
- **Resource Performance**: Analysis of resource loading times
- **Geographic Performance**: Performance metrics by location

## Performance Analysis
---

### Identifying Performance Issues

The Performance Dashboard helps you identify performance issues by:

1. **Highlighting Slow Pages**: Pages with performance metrics that exceed recommended thresholds are highlighted.
2. **Tracking Trends**: Performance trends over time help you identify degradations.
3. **Comparing Segments**: Compare performance across different browsers, devices, and geographic locations.

### Diagnosing Performance Problems

When you identify a performance issue, you can diagnose the root cause by:

1. **Resource Analysis**: Identify slow-loading resources that may be impacting page performance.
2. **Long Task Analysis**: Find JavaScript execution that blocks the main thread.
3. **Waterfall View**: Visualize the loading sequence of resources to identify bottlenecks.
4. **User Journey Analysis**: Analyze user paths through your application to understand how performance issues affect different user flows.

## Performance Optimization
---

Based on the insights from FlashCat RUM, you can implement various optimizations:

### Improving LCP

- Optimize and compress images
- Implement lazy loading for below-the-fold content
- Use a Content Delivery Network (CDN)
- Preload critical resources
- Reduce server response times

### Reducing FID

- Break up long tasks
- Optimize JavaScript execution
- Remove unused JavaScript
- Use a web worker for complex calculations
- Minimize main thread work

### Minimizing CLS

- Include size attributes for images and video elements
- Reserve space for ads and embeds
- Avoid inserting content above existing content
- Precompute sufficient space for dynamic content
- Use transform animations instead of animations that trigger layout changes

## Setting Performance Alerts
---

FlashCat RUM allows you to set up alerts for performance issues:

1. Navigate to **RUM** > **Applications** > **Your Application** > **Alerts**
2. Click **New Alert**
3. Select a performance metric (e.g., LCP, FID, CLS)
4. Define the threshold and condition (e.g., LCP > 2.5s)
5. Configure notification settings
6. Click **Create Alert**

When the alert is triggered, you'll receive a notification through your configured channels (email, Slack, etc.).

## Performance Reporting
---

FlashCat RUM provides several reporting options for performance data:

1. **Scheduled Reports**: Set up weekly or monthly performance reports to be sent via email.
2. **Custom Dashboards**: Create custom dashboards that focus on the performance metrics most important to your team.
3. **API Access**: Access performance data programmatically through the FlashCat API for integration with other tools.

## Best Practices
---

1. **Set Performance Budgets**: Define acceptable thresholds for key performance metrics and monitor them regularly.
2. **Segment Your Data**: Analyze performance across different user segments (device, browser, location) to identify specific issues.
3. **Correlate with Business Metrics**: Connect performance data with business metrics like conversion rates to understand the impact of performance on your business.
4. **Regular Audits**: Conduct regular performance audits to identify and address issues before they impact users.
5. **A/B Testing**: Use A/B testing to measure the impact of performance optimizations on user experience and business metrics.

By leveraging FlashCat RUM's performance monitoring capabilities, you can ensure your web application delivers a fast and smooth experience to all users, regardless of their device, browser, or location.
