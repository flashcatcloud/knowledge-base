## Overview
---

Error tracking is a crucial component of Real User Monitoring (RUM) that helps you identify and fix issues affecting your users. FlashCat RUM automatically captures JavaScript errors, network failures, and other issues that impact the user experience, providing detailed context for faster debugging.

## Types of Errors Tracked
---

FlashCat RUM tracks several types of errors:

### JavaScript Errors

JavaScript errors include syntax errors, runtime errors, and unhandled promise rejections. These errors can prevent your application from functioning correctly and lead to a poor user experience.

### Network Errors

Network errors occur when requests to your backend services or third-party APIs fail. These include:

- Failed XHR/Fetch requests
- Timeout errors
- CORS errors
- 4xx and 5xx HTTP status codes

### Resource Loading Errors

Resource loading errors occur when the browser fails to load resources like images, scripts, stylesheets, or fonts. These errors can lead to missing content or broken functionality.

### Custom Errors

In addition to automatically tracked errors, you can manually track custom errors using the RUM SDK. This is useful for tracking business logic errors or other issues specific to your application.

## Error Dashboard
---

The FlashCat RUM Error Dashboard provides a comprehensive view of errors occurring in your application. To access the dashboard:

1. Log in to the FlashCat console
2. Navigate to **RUM** > **Applications** > **Your Application**
3. Click on the **Errors** tab

The dashboard includes:

- **Error Overview**: A summary of error trends over time
- **Top Errors**: The most frequent errors affecting your users
- **Error Distribution**: Breakdown of errors by type, browser, device, and location
- **Error Impact**: Analysis of how errors affect user experience metrics

## Error Details
---

When you click on an error in the dashboard, you can view detailed information about it:

### Error Context

- **Error Message**: The error message thrown by the browser or your code
- **Error Type**: The type of error (e.g., ReferenceError, TypeError)
- **Stack Trace**: The call stack at the time the error occurred
- **Source Code**: The relevant code snippet where the error occurred

### User Context

- **Browser and Device**: The browser, operating system, and device where the error occurred
- **User Information**: User ID, email, or other custom attributes (if configured)
- **Geographic Location**: Country, region, and city where the user was located

### Application Context

- **URL**: The page where the error occurred
- **Session ID**: The session during which the error occurred
- **View ID**: The specific view where the error occurred
- **Custom Attributes**: Any custom attributes you've configured

### Error Timeline

- **Previous Actions**: User actions that preceded the error
- **Related Errors**: Other errors that occurred in the same session
- **Performance Metrics**: Performance data around the time of the error

## Error Analysis
---

FlashCat RUM provides several tools to help you analyze and understand errors:

### Error Grouping

Similar errors are automatically grouped together to help you focus on the most impactful issues. Errors are grouped based on:

- Error message and type
- Stack trace similarity
- Source location

### Error Trends

Track error trends over time to identify:

- Spikes in error rates that may indicate a new issue
- Gradual increases that may indicate a degrading system
- Correlation with deployments or other events

### Error Impact Analysis

Understand the impact of errors on your users and business:

- **User Impact**: Number and percentage of users affected by each error
- **Session Impact**: How errors affect session duration and bounce rates
- **Conversion Impact**: How errors affect conversion rates and business metrics

## Error Debugging
---

FlashCat RUM provides several features to help you debug errors:

### Channel Integration

FlashCat RUM offers a unique feature that allows you to integrate error tracking with your Flashduty channels. By enabling this integration, you can automatically receive alerts in your channels when errors occur in your application. This provides immediate visibility into issues affecting your users and helps you respond faster.

To enable channel integration:

1. Navigate to **RUM** > **Applications** > **Your Application** > **Settings**
2. Under **Integrations**, toggle on **Channel Integration**
3. Select the channel where you want to receive error alerts
4. Configure the error conditions that should trigger alerts (e.g., new errors, error rate thresholds)
5. Save your settings

### Network Request Inspection

View the details of network requests associated with errors, including:

- Request and response headers
- Request payload
- Response body
- Timing information

### Console Logs

View console logs from the user's browser around the time of the error. This includes:

- `console.log()` messages
- `console.warn()` messages
- `console.error()` messages

### Source Maps

If you've configured source maps, FlashCat RUM can show you the original source code instead of minified code in stack traces, making it easier to identify the root cause of errors.

## Custom Error Tracking
---

In addition to automatic error tracking, you can manually track errors using the RUM SDK:

```javascript
// Import the FlashCat RUM SDK
import { flashcatRum } from '@flashcatcloud/browser-rum';

// Track a custom error
try {
  // Your code that might throw an error
} catch (error) {
  flashcatRum.addError(error, {
    source: 'custom',
    context: {
      // Additional context about the error
      userId: '123',
      action: 'checkout',
      cartValue: 99.99
    }
  });
}
```

You can also track errors with custom messages:

```javascript
// Track an error with a custom message
flashcatRum.addError('Payment processing failed', {
  source: 'custom',
  context: {
    paymentMethod: 'credit_card',
    amount: 99.99
  }
});
```

## Error Alerting
---

FlashCat RUM allows you to set up alerts for error conditions:

1. Navigate to **RUM** > **Applications** > **Your Application** > **Alerts**
2. Click **New Alert**
3. Select an error metric (e.g., error rate, new error)
4. Define the threshold and condition (e.g., error rate > 1%)
5. Configure notification settings
6. Click **Create Alert**

When the alert is triggered, you'll receive a notification through your configured channels (email, Slack, etc.).

## Error Resolution Workflow
---

FlashCat RUM supports an error resolution workflow to help you track and manage errors:

1. **Triage**: Review new errors and prioritize them based on impact
2. **Assign**: Assign errors to team members for investigation
3. **Investigate**: Use the debugging tools to identify the root cause
4. **Resolve**: Mark errors as resolved once fixed
5. **Monitor**: Track error metrics to ensure the fix is effective

## Best Practices
---

1. **Set Up Source Maps**: Configure source maps to make debugging minified code easier
2. **Add User Context**: Configure the RUM SDK to include user information for better error context
3. **Track Custom Errors**: Use the SDK to track business logic errors and other custom issues
4. **Set Up Alerts**: Configure alerts for critical errors and error rate thresholds
5. **Regular Review**: Schedule regular error review sessions with your team
6. **Error Budgets**: Define acceptable error rates and track them as part of your SLOs

By leveraging FlashCat RUM's error tracking capabilities, you can quickly identify, diagnose, and fix issues affecting your users, leading to a more reliable and enjoyable user experience.
