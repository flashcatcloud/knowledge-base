## Overview
---

User action tracking is a powerful feature of Flashduty RUM that allows you to monitor how users interact with your web application. By tracking user actions, you can gain insights into user behavior, identify usability issues, and optimize conversion flows.

## Automatic Action Tracking
---

Flashduty RUM automatically tracks common user interactions with your web application, including:

### Click Actions

Click actions are tracked when a user clicks on an interactive element such as:

- Buttons
- Links
- Form elements (checkboxes, radio buttons, etc.)
- Custom interactive elements with click event listeners

For each click action, Flashduty RUM captures:

- The element that was clicked
- The text content or identifier of the element
- The timing of the click
- The page context where the click occurred

### Page Navigation

Page navigation actions are tracked when a user navigates between pages in your application, including:

- Direct URL entry
- Link clicks that lead to a new page
- Form submissions
- History API navigation (for single-page applications)

For each navigation action, Flashduty RUM captures:

- The source URL
- The destination URL
- The navigation timing
- The navigation method (e.g., link click, form submission)

### Form Interactions

Form interactions are tracked when a user interacts with form elements, including:

- Form submissions
- Input field interactions
- Select dropdown changes
- Checkbox and radio button toggles

For each form interaction, Flashduty RUM captures:

- The form element that was interacted with
- The type of interaction
- The timing of the interaction
- The form context (excluding sensitive data)

## Custom Action Tracking
---

In addition to automatic action tracking, you can manually track custom actions that are specific to your application. This is useful for tracking:

- Business-specific user flows
- Complex interactions that aren't automatically captured
- Virtual page views in single-page applications
- Custom events that represent important user milestones

### Tracking Custom Actions

To track a custom action, use the `addAction` method of the RUM SDK:

```javascript
// Track a simple custom action
flashcatRum.addAction('click', 'Add to Cart Button', {
  product_id: '12345',
  product_name: 'Wireless Headphones',
  price: 99.99,
  currency: 'USD'
});
```

The `addAction` method takes the following parameters:

1. **Action Type**: A string that categorizes the action (e.g., 'click', 'scroll', 'hover')
2. **Action Name**: A descriptive name for the action
3. **Action Context**: An optional object containing additional information about the action

### Tracking User Flows

You can track complex user flows by combining multiple custom actions:

```javascript
// Track a user flow
flashcatRum.addAction('flow_start', 'Checkout Process Started', {
  cart_value: 99.99,
  items_count: 3
});

// Later in the flow
flashcatRum.addAction('flow_step', 'Shipping Information Completed', {
  shipping_method: 'express'
});

// At the end of the flow
flashcatRum.addAction('flow_complete', 'Purchase Completed', {
  order_id: '67890',
  payment_method: 'credit_card'
});
```

### Tracking Virtual Page Views

For single-page applications, you can track virtual page views:

```javascript
// Track a virtual page view
flashcatRum.addAction('page_view', 'Product Details Page', {
  product_id: '12345',
  product_category: 'Electronics'
});
```

## Action Dashboard
---

The Flashduty RUM Action Dashboard provides a comprehensive view of user actions in your application. To access the dashboard:

1. Log in to the Flashcat console
2. Navigate to **RUM** > **Applications** > **Your Application**
3. Click on the **Actions** tab

The dashboard includes:

- **Action Overview**: A summary of action trends over time
- **Top Actions**: The most frequent actions performed by users
- **Action Distribution**: Breakdown of actions by type, page, and user segment
- **Action Performance**: Analysis of action loading times and errors

## Action Analysis
---

Flashduty RUM provides several tools to help you analyze user actions:

### User Flows

Visualize common user flows through your application to identify:

- Popular paths through your application
- Points where users commonly drop off
- Unexpected navigation patterns

### Conversion Funnels

Create and analyze conversion funnels to track how users progress through multi-step processes:

1. Define the steps in your funnel (e.g., Product View → Add to Cart → Checkout → Purchase)
2. Analyze conversion rates between each step
3. Identify steps with high drop-off rates
4. Segment funnels by user attributes, device type, or location

### Action Timing

Analyze the timing of user actions to identify performance issues:

- Time between actions
- Action loading time
- Time spent on each page
- Time to first interaction

### Frustration Signals

Identify signs of user frustration associated with actions:

- **Rage Clicks**: Multiple rapid clicks on the same element
- **Dead Clicks**: Clicks on non-interactive elements
- **Error Clicks**: Clicks that result in errors
- **Form Abandonment**: Users abandoning forms after partial completion

## Action Replay
---

Flashduty RUM's User Journey Analysis allows you to analyze user paths through your application, focusing on specific actions:

1. Navigate to **RUM** > **Applications** > **Your Application** > **Sessions**
2. Filter sessions by action type or action name
3. Click on a session to view the replay
4. Use the action timeline to jump to specific actions in the session

This helps you understand the context around user actions and identify usability issues.

## Action Alerting
---

Flashduty RUM allows you to set up alerts for action-related conditions:

1. Navigate to **RUM** > **Applications** > **Your Application** > **Alerts**
2. Click **New Alert**
3. Select an action metric (e.g., action count, action error rate)
4. Define the threshold and condition (e.g., checkout completion rate < 50%)
5. Configure notification settings
6. Click **Create Alert**

When the alert is triggered, you'll receive a notification through your configured channels (email, Slack, etc.).

## Privacy Considerations
---

When tracking user actions, it's important to consider privacy:

1. **Sensitive Data**: Avoid capturing sensitive user data in action context
2. **Personal Information**: Mask or anonymize personal information
3. **Consent**: Ensure you have user consent for tracking actions
4. **Data Retention**: Configure appropriate data retention policies

Flashduty RUM provides privacy controls to help you comply with regulations like GDPR and CCPA:

```javascript
// Configure privacy settings
flashcatRum.init({
  // ... other configuration options
  defaultPrivacyLevel: 'mask-user-input',
  actionNameAttribute: 'data-action-name',
  trackUserInteractions: true,
  trackingConsent: 'pending' // 'pending', 'granted', or 'not-granted'
});

// Later, when consent is granted
flashcatRum.setTrackingConsent('granted');
```

## Best Practices
---

1. **Consistent Naming**: Use consistent naming conventions for custom actions
2. **Contextual Data**: Include relevant contextual data with each action
3. **Action Hierarchy**: Organize actions in a logical hierarchy
4. **Performance Impact**: Be mindful of the performance impact of tracking too many actions
5. **Regular Analysis**: Regularly analyze action data to identify trends and issues
6. **A/B Testing**: Use action tracking to measure the impact of A/B tests

By leveraging Flashduty RUM's user action tracking capabilities, you can gain deep insights into how users interact with your application, identify usability issues, and optimize conversion flows to improve the overall user experience.
