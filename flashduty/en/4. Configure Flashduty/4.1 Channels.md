A channel serves as a core platform for organizing and managing incident troubleshooting. It aims to separately manage alerts from different teams, business systems, or service modules. Each channel typically corresponds to a specific scope that teams routinely operate and maintain.

## Creating a Channel
---

### Channel Planning Guidelines

&check; It's recommended to create channels based on dimensions such as business systems or team responsibilities. For example, creating a channel for an order management system that receives incident events related to order processing workflows. This ensures focused information and efficient collaboration, allowing team members to quickly access information directly relevant to their work, improve processing efficiency, reduce cross-domain interference, promote clear responsibilities and task tracking, and enhance project management and problem-solving timeliness.

&cross; Avoid routing different types or unrelated alerts to the same channel. For instance, don't mix order-related alerts with hardware resource or network-related incident events in one channel. This would make processing, assignment, and analysis confusing, making it difficult for teams to accurately identify and prioritize issues, thus reducing work efficiency.

### Channel Permissions
To meet special business needs, channels provide flexible permission management options（Access Level）, ensuring that information is only visible to certain members or teams. The following are the two main permission settings:

- **Public:** The channel is visible to all users, and all users can view and operate incidents within the channel (non-channel management members or account administrators cannot modify channel configurations).
- **Private:** The channel and its contents are only accessible to the channel creator and account administrators (Account Admin) as well as the main account. Other members can view the channel's contents by sharing the incident link.


### Getting Started
Log in to the console and navigate to: **Incident Management => Channel => Create Channel**.

- **Channel Name:** Recommended to name and plan based on department, team, or business type for better understanding of the channel's purpose.
- **Description:** Briefly summarize the business handled by this channel and the types of alerts it receives.
- **Management Team:** Set the management team during creation. **Team members have full operational permissions** for the channel, while non-creators have read-only access to channel configurations.
- **Auto-close Timeout:** Incidents not closed within N minutes will be **automatically closed by the system** (applies to all new incidents in this channel). Timeout-closed incidents will also **receive corresponding closure notifications** (notification channels depend on [escalation rule](https://docs.flashcat.cloud/en/flashduty/escalate-rule-settings?nav=01JCQ7A4N4WRWNXW8EWEHXCMF5) configuration).
- **Access Level:** The channel is visible to which users, **public** means all users can view and operate incidents within the channel, **private** means only the creator, management team, and main account can view and operate incidents within the channel.
- If incident assignment planning isn't ready, you can **skip setting escalation rules** and configure them after creation.
- Integration types added during creation are **exclusive integrations** that only apply to this channel and can be configured later after creation.

## Managing Channels
---
### Channel Overview
- Account members can see all channels but can only operate those they're responsible for.
- Hover over a channel and click the star to **favorite or unfavorite** it.
- By default, all channels are shown; you can **view channels related to "me" through "My Managed" or "My Favorites"**.
- When you have many channels but your focused channels are sorted lower, you can **use the sorting feature in the top right to move your focused channels forward**.
- Sorting is customizable and **only affects the current user, not others**.

### Modifying Information
- Channel name, description, auto-close timeout, and management team can be modified in Channel Details -> Basic Settings.
- Disabled channels stop receiving alerts but allow continued operation of incidents and related configurations.
- Deleting a channel doesn't delete existing incident data, but deleted channels cannot be recovered, so proceed with caution.

### Incident List
- Shows all incidents in the channel, defaulting to open incidents; filter by **progress status**.
- Filter by incident status, responders, time, title, and other conditions.
- Select multiple **incidents with the same status** for batch closing, acknowledging, etc.
- **Merge** combines multiple incidents into one for processing, supporting cross-channel incident merging.
- **For more details, see [Search and View Incidents](https://docs.flashcat.cloud/en/flashduty/view-incidents?nav=01JCQ7A4N4WRWNXW8EWEHXCMF5)**.

### Integration Data
- Integrations created under a channel are **exclusive integrations, applying only to that channel**.
- Each integration type generates its webhook URL upon creation; **different integration types are incompatible**.
- Drop rules discard events meeting specified conditions, configurable by integration type, severity, etc.
- With multiple drop rules, priority matches from high to low, stopping at first match.
- Dropped events are **completely invisible in the system**. If alerts are missing, check drop rule configurations.

### Escalation Rules
- Manage incident notification rules, channels, escalation rules, etc.
- Incident notifications match strategies in sequence, stopping after first match.
- Multiple strategies can be freely reordered; ensure notification rules meet business requirements before adjusting.
- For more about **escalation rules**, see [Escalation Rules](https://docs.flashcat.cloud/en/flashduty/escalate-rule-settings?nav=01JCQ7A4N4WRWNXW8EWEHXCMF5).

### Reduce Noise Settings
- Alert grouping combines similar or related alerts into one incident.
- Configure grouping by alert title, severity, or label dimensions.
- Incident suppression automatically blocks notifications for identical incidents within a time period.
