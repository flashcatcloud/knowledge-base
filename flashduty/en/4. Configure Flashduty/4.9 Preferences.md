## Notification Methods

- Different notification methods can be configured for different alert severity levels.
- Notifications will follow personal preferences **only when incidents are directly assigned to an individual, or when assigned through an escalation rule with personal chat enabled and set to follow personal preferences**.
- When configuring IM applications like Dingtalk, WeCom, or Feishu/Lark, you need to first associate the application to receive corresponding notifications.


## FAQ

<details>
  <summary>Why am I not receiving notifications even though I've set up personal notification preferences?</summary>
  How Flashduty assigns responders and sends notifications depends solely on the escalation rule settings. This means if you haven't set up an escalation rule, no notifications will be triggered when an incident occurs.
  
  Additionally, the personal chat notification channel in escalation rules supports two settings: "Follow Personal Preferences" and "Follow Unified Settings". Only under "Follow Personal Preferences" will notifications be sent according to your personal settings. If "Follow Unified Settings" is selected, all users will receive notifications according to this unified setting, regardless of their personal preferences.

  Check your specific settings in Channel Details => Escalation Rules.
