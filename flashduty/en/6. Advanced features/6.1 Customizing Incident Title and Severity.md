Customize incident severity and title information by modifying push parameters.

## Customizing Severity
---

**Add a Query parameter 'severity' in the push URL to override the incident severity.**

:::tip
Compatible with all integrations that report alerts via webhook.
:::

Some alert integrations (such as AWS CloudWatch) don't support severity differentiation. In such cases, we can specify it in the integration push URL. Different alert policies can be configured with different push URLs to achieve alert severity differentiation.

Example: The following URL specifies a severity parameter with the value Info (**note the capital first letter**). Alerts pushed through this URL will always have their severity overridden to Info.
```

```

**Add a Query parameter 'title_rule' in the push URL to dynamically generate incident titles.**

### Generate Using Simple Syntax

Use :: to separate substrings. Each substring can be either a fixed string or a variable prefixed with \$. Variable content will be extracted from labels; if not found, no variable replacement occurs.

Examples:

| Rule | Label Values | Generated Content |
| --- | ---| ---- |
|\$resource::\$check | {"resource": "127.0.0.1", "check": "cpu idle low"} | 127.0.0.1 / cpu idle low |
|\$resource::\$check | {"resource": "127.0.0.1"} | 127.0.0.1 / \$check |
|\$resource::Host Down | {"resource": "127.0.0.1"} | 127.0.0.1 / Host Down |


### Generate Using \${var} Label References

Use [TPL] as prefix and \${} to reference variables. Variable content will be extracted from labels; if not found, replaced with \<no value\>.

Examples:

| Rule | Label Values | Generated Content |
| --- | ---| ---- |
|[TPL]\${resource} / \${check}| {"resource": "127.0.0.1", "check": "cpu idle low"} | 127.0.0.1 / cpu idle low |
|[TPL]\${resource} / \${check} | {"resource": "127.0.0.1"} | 127.0.0.1 / \<no value\> |
|[TPL]\${resource} / Host Down | {"resource": "127.0.0.1"} | 127.0.0.1 / Host Down |


### Generate Using Golang Template Syntax

Use [TPL] as prefix and {{}} to reference variables (can reference labels and other variables). If not found, replaced with \<no value\>. Variable scope refers to [Alert Event Definition](#AlertEvent).

Examples:

| Rule | Label Values | Generated Content |
| --- | ---| ---- |
|[TPL]{{.Labels.resource}} / {{.Labels.check}}| {"resource": "127.0.0.1", "check": "cpu idle low"} | 127.0.0.1 / cpu idle low |
|[TPL]{{.Labels.resource}} / {{.Labels.check}} | {"resource": "127.0.0.1"} | 127.0.0.1 / \<no value\> |
|[TPL]{{.Labels.resource}} / Host Down | {"resource": "127.0.0.1"} | 127.0.0.1 / Host Down |

## FAQ

<details>
  <summary>What happens if a label doesn't exist when using labels to generate titles?</summary>
  
  It depends on which variable retrieval method you use. The title might retain the original variable information or use \<no value\> as a replacement.
  
  Even if variables cannot be retrieved, it won't affect alert generation. You can debug with confidence.
