Implement label-based dynamic alert assignment and integrate with your custom systems.

## Use Cases
---

**Alert responders are maintained in the source monitoring system and frequently updated, requiring timely synchronization with Flashduty.**

Case 1:

Customer A has a custom big data task system where internal staff can create various data batch processing tasks. Each task can be configured with primary and secondary responders. When a batch processing task fails, the system prioritizes notifying the primary responder. If the alert remains unresolved after 30 minutes, it escalates to the secondary responder.

Case 2:

Customer B uses Zabbix for host monitoring and has set a responder tag for each host. They want alerts for a host to notify the corresponding responder based on this tag.

Case 3:

Customer C has a custom monitoring system with multiple alert policies, each configured to notify a specific WeCom group. The customer wants to migrate incident response to Flashduty while maintaining the original policy-to-WeCom group relationships and dynamically notify WeCom groups based on these relationships.

## Implementation
---

**Add specific labels or query parameters to override Flashduty's assignment targets for dynamic assignment.**

Parameter format:

- **Replace Responders**:
    - **Parameter Name**: Must match regex: ^layer_person_reset_(\d)_emails$, level number starts from 0. E.g., layer_person_reset_0_emails represents replacing responders in level 1 of the escalation rule.
    - **Parameter Value**: Responder email addresses, multiple addresses separated by ",". E.g., zhangsan@flashcat.cloud,lisi@flashcat.cloud will replace responders with Zhang San and Li Si.
    - **Parameter Location**: Query parameter or label value. E.g., set in N9E alert or automatically generate through label enhancement.
- **Replace WeCom Group Bot**:
    - **Parameter Name**: Must match regex: ^layer_webhook_reset_(\d)_wecoms$, level number starts from 0. E.g., layer_webhook_reset_0_wecoms represents replacing WeCom group bot in level 1 of the escalation rule.
    - **Parameter Value**: Target group bot token, multiple tokens separated by ",". E.g., bbb025a0-e2e8-4b79-939d-82c91a275b06 will replace the group bot with the corresponding bot for this token.
    - **Parameter Location**: Query parameter or label value. E.g., set in N9E alert or automatically generate through label enhancement.

:::tip
When an incident triggers, Flashduty matches existing escalation rules. After matching a rule, it follows the levels for assignment or escalation. If the above parameters are set, the system automatically replaces the responders or group channels.

In the matched escalation rule, only the responders and group targets are changed while other settings remain unchanged, effectively acting as a template escalation rule.

## Push Examples
---

### Set Template Escalation Rule

Configure an escalation rule for the channel. As shown below, this channel has only one assignment level, with Flashcat as the responder and a WeCom group with token ending in 5b96.

### Set Alert Labels

Using custom alert event integration as an example, we'll push a sample alert to the target channel. We set the layer_person_reset_0_emails label to replace level one responders with guoyuhang and yushuangyu. We also set layer_webhook_reset_0_wecoms label to replace level one WeCom group token with one ending in d9c0.

As shown below, the target incident triggered and was assigned normally. Both the responders and target group were replaced as expected.

## FAQ

<details>
  <summary>What if my monitoring system doesn't have these labels?</summary>
  
  1. If your system supports adding labels actively, such as Prometheus or N9E, we recommend adding specific labels directly in the alert policy.
  2. If your system already has relevant labels but with different formats or names, for example, if your hosts have team labels and you need to find corresponding responders based on teams, you can use the label enhancement feature to generate responder-related labels from team labels. For details, please refer to [Configure Label Enhancement](doc-4245896).
