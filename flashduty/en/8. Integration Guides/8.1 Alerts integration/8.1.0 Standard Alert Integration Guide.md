Push alerts from your own system to Flashduty using standard protocols to achieve automated alert noise reduction.

:::tips
Flashduty has already adapted webhook protocols for most common alert systems. For these systems, you should first use their corresponding integrations for simplicity. This integration provides a standard HTTP interface that requires development adaptation. The advantage is that you can push any alerts you want to handle through on-call.

## Steps

### In Flashduty

You can obtain a push URL through either of these two methods:

#### Using Private Integration

Choose this method when you don't need to route alerts to different channels. This is the simpler option.

  1. Go to the Flashduty console, select **Channel**, and enter a channel's details page
  2. Select the **Integration** tab, click **Add Integration**, and enter the integration page
  3. Choose **Standard Alert** integration and click **Save** to generate a card
  4. Click the generated card to view the **push URL**, copy it for later use, and you're done

#### Using Shared Integration

Choose this method when you need to route alerts to different channels based on the alert payload information.

  1. Go to the Flashduty console, select **Integration Center=>Alerts** to enter the integration selection page
  2. Select **Standard Alert** integration:
        - **Integration Name**: Define a name for this integration
  3. Click **Save** and copy the newly generated **push URL** for later use
  4. Click **Create Route** to configure routing rules for the integration. You can match different alerts to different channels based on conditions, or set a default channel as a fallback and adjust as needed later
  5. Complete

## Implementation Protocol
--- 

Please refer to the [Developer Documentation](https://developer.flashcat.cloud/zh/flashduty/custom-alert) to complete the protocol development.

## Best Practices
---

1. Send events to Flashduty when alert status changes
2. When an alert recovers, send an event with status "Ok" to close the alert. Otherwise, the alert will remain open. If your alert system doesn't have recovery events, we recommend manually sending recovery events
3. Labels are event descriptions. You should enrich label content as much as possible (specified when sending or generated through enrichment rules), such as:
   - Alert source, like host, cluster, check, or metric
   - Alert ownership information, like team, owner
   - Alert category information, like class (api, db, net)


## FAQ
---

<details>
  <summary>Why haven't I received alerts in Flashduty?</summary>

  #### In Flashduty
  
  1. Check if the integration shows **Latest Event Time**? If not, Flashduty hasn't received the push, prioritize checking your system
  2. If you're using **Shared Integration**, first confirm whether you've configured **Routing Rules**. Without routing rules, the system will reject new pushes since there's no channel to receive your alerts. In this case, simply configure routing rules to your desired channel

  #### In Your System

  1. Confirm that your request URL exactly matches the URL in the integration details
  2. Verify that your service can access the external domain api.flashcat.cloud. If not, you need to enable external network access for your server or specifically for the Flashduty domain
  3. Print the response from the Flashduty service to check for specific messages

  If you still can't identify the root cause after these steps, please contact us with the **request_id** from the request response
