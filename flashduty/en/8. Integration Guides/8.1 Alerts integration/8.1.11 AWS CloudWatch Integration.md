You can obtain an integration push URL through either of these two methods:

### Using Private Integration

Choose this method when you don't need to route alert events to different channels. It's simpler.

  2. Select the **Integration** tab, click **Add Integration** to enter the integration page
  3. Choose **AWS CloudWatch** integration, click **Save** to generate a card
  4. Click the generated card to view the **push URL**, copy it for later use, and you're done

### Using Shared Integration

Choose this method when you need to route alerts to different channels based on the alert event's payload information.

  1. Go to the Flashduty console, select **Integration Center=>Alert Events** to enter the integration selection page
  2. Select **AWS CloudWatch** integration:
        - **Integration Name**: Define a name for this integration
  3. Click **Save** and copy the newly generated **push URL** for later use
  4. Click **Create Route** to configure routing rules for the integration. You can match different alerts to different channels based on conditions, or set a default channel as a fallback and adjust as needed later
