Sync Skywalking alert events to Flashduty via webhook for automated alert noise reduction.

## In Flashduty

You can obtain an integration push URL through either of these two methods:

### Using Private Integration

Choose this method when you don't need to route alert events to different channels. It's simpler and recommended.

<details>
  <summary>Expand</summary>
  
  1. Go to the Flashduty console, select **Channel**, and enter a specific channel's details page
  2. Select the **Integrations** tab, click **Add Integration** to enter the integration page
  3. Choose **Skywalking** integration and click **Save** to generate a card
  4. Click the generated card to view the **push URL**, copy it for later use, and you're done
  
</details>

### Using Shared Integration

Choose this method when you need to route alerts to different channels based on the alert event's payload information.

<details>
  <summary>Expand</summary>
  
  1. Go to the Flashduty console, select **Integration Center=>Alert Events** to enter the integration selection page
  2. Select **Skywalking** integration:
        - **Integration Name**: Define a name for this integration
  3. Click **Save** and copy the newly generated **push URL** for later use
  4. Click **Create Route** to configure routing rules for the integration. You can match different alerts to different channels based on conditions, or set a default channel as a fallback and adjust as needed later
  5. Done

## I. Modify Skywalking Service Configuration File

1. Log in to the Skywalking server
2. Locate the Skywalking configuration file ./config/alarm-settings.yml
3. Add Level tags to the alert rules

```
# Tags are supported in v8.6.0+ versions only, can be omitted for other versions
# Level values: Critical, Warning, Info
# Case sensitive
rules:
    endpoint_relation_resp_time_rule:
        expression: sum(endpoint_relation_resp_time > 1000) >= 2
        period: 10
        message: Response time of endpoint relation {name} is more than 1000ms in 2 minutes of last 10 minutes
        tags:
            Level: Warning
```
4. Add the FlashDuty webhook URL

```
# Add at the bottom of the configuration file
# For v8.8.0 ~ v9.5.0
webhooks:
    - url: https://api.flashcat.cloud/event/push/alert/skywalking?integration_key=18c7f1551df55fa28a1a87f0846d9d1e131

# For v10.0.0
hooks:
  webhook:
    default:
      is-default: true
      urls:
        - https://api.flashcat.cloud/event/push/alert/skywalking?integration_key=18c7f1551df55fa28a1a87f0846d9d1e131
```

5. After editing, save and restart the Skywalking service to apply the configuration
