You can obtain an integration push URL through either of these two methods:

### Using Private Integration

Choose this simpler option when you don't need to route alert events to different channels.

  <summary>Expand</summary>
  
  1. Go to the Flashduty console, select **Channel**, and enter a channel's details page
  2. Select the **Integrations** tab, click **Add Integration** to enter the integration page
  3. Choose **AWS EventBridge** integration and click **Save** to generate a card
  4. Click the generated card to view the **push URL**, copy it for later use, and you're done
  
</details>

### Using Shared Integration

Choose this option when you need to route alerts to different channels based on the alert event payload.

<details>
  <summary>Expand</summary>
  
  1. Go to the Flashduty console, select **Integration Center=>Alert Events** to enter the integration selection page
  2. Select **AWS EventBridge** integration:
        - **Integration Name**: Define a name for this integration
  3. Click **Save** and copy the newly generated **push URL** for later use
  4. Click **Create Route** to configure routing rules. You can match different alerts to different channels based on conditions, or set a default channel as a fallback, and adjust as needed later

## II. Status Mapping

<div class="md-block">
  
1. Since AWS EventBridge events don't have severity levels, all events pushed to FlashDuty will have a Warning severity
2. AWS EventBridge events only have triggers without recovery states, so events received by FlashDuty won't automatically associate with recovery
