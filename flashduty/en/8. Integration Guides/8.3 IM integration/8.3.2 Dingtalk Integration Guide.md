### 5. Apply for Application Permissions

Enter the Permission Management page, apply for `qyapi_chat_manage` and `qyapi_robot_sendmsg` permissions. These two permissions will allow the current application to obtain its own group chat information and send messages to groups or individuals.

## IV. Application Release and Usage
---

After completing the above steps, go to **Application Release - Version Management and Release**, create a new version, then proceed with the release (make sure to adjust the visibility to all employees, otherwise others cannot use it)

<img src="https://download.flashcat.cloud/dingtalk-self-app-release-1.png" alt="drawing" width="500"/>

After the application is released, you can access it via mobile/PC client. First-time access requires login and account association (Dingtalk 《-》 Flashduty), subsequent uses will be login-free.

1. Mobile: Access the web application through Dingtalk > Workspace > Search application name > Open application.
2. PC: Access the web application through Dingtalk > Workspace > Search application name > Open application.

## V. Common Issues
---
1. **Cannot deliver messages to individuals**, operation record shows `Application Not Associated`?

    - Go to Dingtalk > Workspace > Search application name > Open application, complete one login and account association (Dingtalk 《-》 Flashduty), so the system can obtain user identity for message pushing

2. **Message card buttons are ineffective or show errors?**

    - Go to Dingtalk > Workspace > Search application name > Open application, complete one login and account association (Dingtalk 《-》 Flashduty). If already logged in, try clicking the menu in the upper right corner, switch accounts, and log in again to bind the account
    - Ensure you have purchased sufficient licenses. You can check license usage in Console > Billing Center

3. **Escalation rule Dingtalk group chat list is empty?**

    - Go to Dingtalk, select group chat and install the Cool App, otherwise the group chat list cannot be obtained
    - Return to the escalation rule configuration page, refresh and reselect the group chat list
    - If still unable to get the group chat list, try uninstalling the Cool App from the group and repeat the above steps. If it still doesn't work, please contact customer or dedicated technical support
