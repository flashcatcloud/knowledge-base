Push alerts from your own system to Flashduty using standard protocols to achieve automated alert noise reduction.

:::tips
Flashduty has already adapted webhook protocols for most common alert systems. For these systems, you should first use their corresponding integrations for simplicity. This integration provides a standard HTTP interface that requires development adaptation. The advantage is that you can push any alerts you want to handle through on-call.

## Steps

### In Flashduty

You can obtain a push URL through either of these two methods:

#### Using Private Integration

Choose this method when you don't need to route alerts to different channels. This is the simpler option.

<details>
  <summary>Expand</summary>
  
  1. Go to the Flashduty console, select **Channel**, and enter a channel's details page
  2. Select the **Integration** tab, click **Add Integration**, and enter the integration page
  3. Choose **Standard Alert** integration and click **Save** to generate a card
  4. Click the generated card to view the **push URL**, copy it for later use, and you're done
    
</details>

#### Using Shared Integration

Choose this method when you need to route alerts to different channels based on the alert payload information.

<details>
  <summary>Expand</summary>
  
  1. Go to the Flashduty console, select **Integration Center=>Alerts** to enter the integration selection page
  2. Select **Standard Alert** integration:
        - **Integration Name**: Define a name for this integration
  3. Click **Save** and copy the newly generated **push URL** for later use
  4. Click **Create Route** to configure routing rules for the integration. You can match different alerts to different channels based on conditions, or set a default channel as a fallback and adjust as needed later
  5. Complete

|  alert_key   |   Yes    | string | Event grouping basis, different alert events are grouped into one alert based on this field and time window                                                                                                                                      |
|  title_rule  |    No    | string | Alert title generation rule, in the form of `$a::b::$c`, substrings are separated by `::`; each substring can be a fixed string or a variable prefixed with `$`. Variable content will be extracted from the labels parameter, error if not found. By default, the system will generate rules by extracting service, cluster, resource, and check tags from the labels field |
| description  |    No    | string | Alert description, no more than 2048 characters                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
|    labels    |    No    |  map   | Alert label collection, key is the label name, value is the label value. Labels are event descriptions, crucial for subsequent correlation and noise reduction. 1. Label keys and values are case-sensitive strings. 2. Label keys should not exceed 128 characters. 3. Maximum 50 labels allowed. `Label content reference` [Best Practices](#Best-Practices) |

## II. Best Practices

1. Send events to Flashcat Cloud when alert status changes or labels are updated
2. When an alert recovers, send an event with status Ok to close the alert. Otherwise, the alert will remain open. If your alert system doesn't have recovery events, we recommend manually sending recovery events
3. Labels are event descriptions. You should enrich label content as much as possible (specified when sending or generated through enrichment rules), such as:
   - Alert source information: host, cluster, check, or metric
   - Alert ownership information: team, owner
   - Alert category information: class (api, db, net)
   - Alert details link for jumping to the alert system
4. alert_key is used to group different alert events into one alert. For example, when a host's cpu.idle drops below threshold, escalates, and recovers, you should send 3 events with the same alert_key, which will be grouped into one alert
5. title_rule is used to generate alert display titles. It's recommended to include the source system alert name (commonly defined as rule_name or check) and add cluster, host, and other information as auxiliary reminders
