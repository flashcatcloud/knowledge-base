Push alert events from your own system to Flashduty through standard protocols to achieve automated alert noise reduction.

:::tips
Flashduty has already adapted webhook protocols for most common alert systems. For these systems, you should first use the corresponding integration for simplicity. This integration provides a standard HTTP interface that requires your development for adaptation. The advantage is that you can push any alert events you want to handle through on-call.
:::

## Steps
---

### In Flashduty

You can obtain an integration push URL through either of the following two methods:

#### Using Dedicated Integration

When you don't need to route alert events to different collaboration spaces, this method is preferred as it's simpler.

<details>
  <summary>Expand</summary>
  
  1. Enter the Flashduty console, select **Collaboration Space**, and enter the details page of a space
  2. Select the **Integrations** tab, click **Add Integration**, and enter the add integration page
  3. Select **Standard Alert Event** integration, click **Save** to generate a card
  4. Click the generated card to view the **Push URL**, copy it for later use, and you're done
    
</details>

#### Using Shared Integration

When you need to route alert events to different collaboration spaces based on the alert event's Payload information, this method is preferred.

<details>
  <summary>Expand</summary>
  
  1. Enter the Flashduty console, select **Integration Center => Alert Events** to enter the integration selection page
  2. Select **Standard Alert Event** integration:
        - **Integration Name**: Define a name for the current integration
  3. Click **Save** and copy the newly generated **Push URL** on the current page for later use
  4. Click **Create Route** to configure routing rules for the integration. You can match different alerts to different collaboration spaces based on conditions, or set a default collaboration space as a fallback, and adjust as needed later
  5. Complete

}

## III. Best Practices <span id="best-practices"></span>
---

1. Send events to Flashduty when alert status changes
2. When an alert recovers, send an event with status Ok to close the alert. Otherwise, the alert will remain open. If your alert system doesn't have recovery events, we recommend manually sending recovery events
3. Labels are event descriptions, and label content should be as rich as possible (specified when sending, or generated through enrichment rules), such as:
   - Alert source, like host, cluster, check, or metric
   - Alert ownership information, like team, owner
   - Alert category information, like class (api, db, net)

## IV. FAQ
---

<details>
  <summary>Why haven't I received alerts in Flashduty?</summary>

  #### In Flashduty
  
  1. Check if the integration shows **Latest Event Time**? If not, it means Flashduty hasn't received the push, prioritize checking your system.
  2. If you're using **Shared Integration**, first confirm if you've configured **Routing Rules**. Without routing rules, the system will directly reject new pushes as there's no collaboration space to handle your alerts. In this case, simply configure routing rules to your desired space.

  #### In Your System

  1. Confirm that your request URL exactly matches the URL in the integration details.
  2. Confirm that your service can access the external domain api.flashcat.cloud. If not, you need to enable external network access for the server or specifically for Flashduty's domain.
  3. Print Flashduty service's response to check for clear information.

  If you still can't find the root cause after these steps, please contact us with the **request_id** from the request response.

<details>
  <summary>Why was the push request successful but no new alerts or incidents were generated?</summary>

  Flashduty uses a 2-layer noise reduction mechanism:

  1. First, it checks for duplicate alert events. If your pushed event is identical to a previously pushed event, the new event will be discarded.
  2. If the new event's status and description match the status, title, and description of the last event of its corresponding alert, the new event will be discarded while updating the alert's attributes.
  3. The new event might be discarded due to matching exclusion, discard, suppression, or silence rules.
  4. When a new event triggers a new alert, the system enters the second layer of noise reduction check, determining if the new alert can be merged into an active incident. If possible, it will only merge into the existing incident without generating a new one.
