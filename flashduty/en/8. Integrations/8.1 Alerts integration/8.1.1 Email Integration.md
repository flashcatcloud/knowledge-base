Generate a unique email address in Flashduty to synchronize alert triggers and recoveries through email.

<div class="hide">

## Steps
---

### Create Email Integration

You can obtain an email address through either of these two methods:

#### Using Private Integration

Choose this simpler option when you don't need to route alerts to different channels.

<details>
  <summary>Expand</summary>
  
  1. Go to the Flashduty console, select **Channel**, and enter a channel's details page
  2. Select the **Integration** tab, click **Add Integration**, and enter the integration page
  3. Choose **Email** integration, click **Save** to generate a card
  4. Click the generated card to view the **Email Address**, copy it for later use, and you're done
    
</details>

#### Using Shared Integration

Choose this option when you need to route alerts to different channels based on the alert payload information.

<details>
  <summary>Expand</summary>
  
  1. Go to the Flashduty console, select **Integration Center=>Alerts**, and enter the integration selection page
  2. Select **Email** integration:
        - **Integration Name**: Define a name for the current integration
        - **Email Address**: Set an easy-to-remember prefix for the email, which must be unique within your account
        - **Push Mode**: Choose when the email should trigger or recover alerts
  3. Copy the **Email Address** from the current page for later use
  4. Configure the default route and select the corresponding channel (after the integration is created, you can go to `Route` to configure more routing rules)
  5. Done
    
</details>
</div>

### Customize Email Integration

#### Email Address

By default, the system generates a unique email address for you. You can modify it, but note that **the email prefix can only contain letters and numbers** and must remain unique within your account.

#### Push Mode

By default, the system creates a new alert for every email, but you can switch the mode to:

1. **Trigger or Update Alert Based on Email Subject**: In this mode, when receiving a new email, the system searches for open alerts based on the email subject. If found, it updates the alert; otherwise, it triggers a new alert.
2. **Trigger or Close Alert Based on Rules**: In this mode, when receiving a new email, the system matches emails according to your rules and either triggers new alerts or closes existing ones based on the matches.

   - You must fill in at least one **trigger** rule
   - You must set regex extraction rules for Alert Key. The system uses this field to find historical alerts for updates or closure; **if regex extraction fails, the system will use the email subject to generate an Alert Key** to ensure alerts aren't lost due to configuration errors
   - You can choose whether to discard emails when no rules match

   Configuration example:

   - Receive all emails, close the alert when the email content contains **RESOLVED**, otherwise trigger a new alert
   - Extract Alert Key from email subject using the rule **/(.\*)/**

### Important Notes

1. The system will reject emails larger than 5MB
2. If the email text content exceeds 32KB, the system will truncate it and add a label in the incident details:

```
body_cut = true
```

3. If the email contains attachments, the system will discard them and add a label in the incident details:

```
attachment_stripped = true
```

4. For new alerts triggered by email, **the title is the email subject, and the description is the email content**

5. If you modify your account domain, this email address will also change, so remember to update the push URL



## Severity Mapping
