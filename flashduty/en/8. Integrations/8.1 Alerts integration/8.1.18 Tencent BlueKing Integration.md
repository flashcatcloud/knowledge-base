The following content has been verified on `BlueKing V6/7 versions`. V5 and below versions are no longer officially supported, and upgrading is recommended.

BlueKing alert policies can trigger `Action Plans`, which can integrate with external systems for complex functionalities. First, create an Action Plan and configure the Flashduty callback URL, then edit the alert policy to associate actions with this plan, enabling automatic alert changes to be pushed to Flashduty. Here are the specific steps:

#### Step 1: Create Action Plan

<div class="md-block">

1. Log in to your BlueKing desktop and enter the `Monitor Platform`;
2. Go to `Configuration-Action Plans` page, click the `Add Plan` button to start creating an action plan;
3. Enter the name as `Send To FlashDuty`, select `HTTP Callback` as the plan type, choose `POST` as the push method, and fill in the integration push URL (obtained after saving the integration), as shown below:

4. Switch to `Body`, select `JSON` type, copy and paste the following information (when an actual alert occurs, BlueKing will render the variable content as the payload to push to the target callback URL):

```
{{alarm.callback_message}}
```

5. Save the plan to complete creation.

#### Step 2: Edit Alert Policy

1. Go to `Configuration-Alert Policies` page, select an existing policy to edit or create a new one;
2. Scroll down to the `Alert Processing` section, select the `Send To FlashDuty` action plan for all three scenarios, and disable `Defense Rules`, as shown below:
