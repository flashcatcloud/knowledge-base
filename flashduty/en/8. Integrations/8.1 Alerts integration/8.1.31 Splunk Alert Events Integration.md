Sync Splunk alert events to Flashduty via webhook for automated alert noise reduction.

## In Flashduty

You can obtain an integration push URL through either of these two methods:

### Using Private Integration

Choose this method when you don't need to route alert events to different channels. It's simpler and recommended.

<details>
  <summary>Expand</summary>
  
  1. Go to the Flashduty console, select **Channel**, and enter a specific channel's details page
  2. Select the **Integration** tab, click **Add Integration** to enter the integration page
  3. Choose **Splunk** integration and click **Save** to generate a card
  4. Click the generated card to view the **push URL**, copy it for later use, and you're Done
  
</details>

### Using Shared Integration

Choose this method when you need to route alerts to different channels based on the alert event's payload information.

<details>
  <summary>Expand</summary>
  
  1. Go to the Flashduty console, select **Integration Center=>Alert Events** to enter the integration selection page
  2. Select **Splunk** integration:
        - **Integration Name**: Define a name for this integration
  3. Click **Save** and copy the newly generated **push URL** for later use
  4. Click **Create Route** to configure routing rules for the integration. You can match different alerts to different channels based on conditions, or set a default channel as a fallback and adjust as needed later
  5. Done

## II. Status Mapping

<div class="md-block">
Since Splunk alert events don't differentiate severity levels, all alert events pushed from Splunk to Flashduty will have a Warning status and won't include recovery events.
