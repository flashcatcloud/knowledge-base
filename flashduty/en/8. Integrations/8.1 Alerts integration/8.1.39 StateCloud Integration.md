You can obtain an integration push URL through either of these two methods:

  2. Select the **Integration** tab, click **Add Integration** to enter the integration page
  3. Select **StateCloud** integration and click **Save** to generate a card
  4. Click the generated card to view the **push URL**, copy it for later use, and you're done

</details>

### Using Shared Integration

Choose this option when you need to route alerts to different channels based on the alert event's payload information.

<details>
  <summary>Expand</summary>
  
  1. Go to the Flashduty console, select **Integration Center=>Alert Events** to enter the integration selection page
  2. Select **StateCloud** integration:
        - **Integration Name**: Define a name for this integration
  3. Click **Save** and copy the newly generated **push URL** for later use
  4. Click **Create Route** to configure routing rules for the integration. You can match different alerts to different channels based on conditions, or set a default channel as a fallback and adjust as needed later
