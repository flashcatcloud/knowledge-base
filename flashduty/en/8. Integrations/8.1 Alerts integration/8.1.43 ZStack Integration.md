You can obtain an integration push URL through either of these two methods:

### Using Dedicated Integration

Choose this method when you don't need to route alert events to different channels. It's simpler and recommended.

  1. Go to the Flashduty console, select **Channel**, and enter a channel's details page
  2. Select the **Integration** tab, click **Add Integration** to enter the integration page
  3. Choose **ZStack** integration and click **Save** to generate a card
  4. Click the generated card to view the **push URL**, copy it for later use, and you're done

</details>

### Using Shared Integration

Choose this method when you need to route alerts to different channels based on the alert event's payload information.

<details>
  <summary>Expand</summary>
  
  1. Go to the Flashduty console, select **Integration Center=>Alert Events** to enter the integration selection page
  2. Select **ZStack** integration:
        - **Integration Name**: Define a name for this integration
  3. Click **Save** and copy the newly generated **push URL** for later use
  4. Click **Create Route** to configure routing rules for the integration. You can match different alerts to different channels based on conditions, or set a default channel as a fallback and adjust as needed later
  5. Done

4. Click `Send Test Message`, if the message is sent successfully, it means the configuration is successful
5. Click `OK` to complete the configuration
