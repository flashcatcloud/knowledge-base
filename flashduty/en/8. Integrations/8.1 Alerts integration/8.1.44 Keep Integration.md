Push alert events to Flashduty through Keep's Flashduty Provider to achieve automated alert noise reduction.

<div class="hide">

## In Flashduty

You can obtain an integration key through either of these 2 methods:

#### Using Dedicated Integration

Choose this method when you don't need to route alert events to different channels - it's simpler.

  1. Enter the Flashduty console, select **Channel**, and go to a specific channel's details page
  2. Select the **Integrations** tab, click **Add Integration** to enter the integration page
  3. Choose **Keep** integration, click **Save** to generate a card
  4. Click the generated card to view the **Integration Key**, copy it for later use, and you're done
    
</details>

#### Using Shared Integration

Choose this method when you need to route alerts to different channels based on the alert event's payload information.

<details>
  <summary>Expand</summary>
  
  1. Enter the Flashduty console, select **Integration Center=>Alert Events** to access the integration selection page
  2. Select **Keep** integration:
        - **Integration Name**: Define a name for this integration
  3. Configure default routing and select the corresponding channel (after the integration is created, you can go to `Route` to configure more routing rules)
  4. Click **Save** and copy the newly generated **Integration Key** for later use
  5. Done
