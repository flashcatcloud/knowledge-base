## In Flashduty

You can obtain an integration key through either of these 2 methods:

#### Using Dedicated Integration

Choose this method when you don't need to route alert events to different channels - it's simpler.

  4. Click the generated card to view the **Integration Key**, copy it for later use, and you're done

#### Using Shared Integration
