## Status Mapping
---

<div class="md-block">
  
Flashduty extracts the status.name information from the webhook payload by default and converts the status according to the following mapping:

| Jira        | Flashduty   | Status              |
| ----------- | ---------- | ------------------- |
| planned     | planned    | Created             |
| to do       | planned    | Created             |
| ready       | ready      | About to Start      |
| processing  | processing | In Progress         |
| open        | processing | In Progress         |
| reopen      | processing | In Progress         |
| in progress | processing | In Progress         |
| canceled    | canceled   | Canceled/Rolled Back|
| aborted     | canceled   | Canceled/Rolled Back|
| done        | done       | Completed           |
| resolved    | done       | Completed           |
