5. **Please Note: As a WeCom service provider, Flashduty offers a long-term free version of the `FlashDuty` application. The app requires WeCom API access license for functionality (passwordless login + messaging). This license is free for up to `60 days`, after which we must purchase a WeCom license for continued use.**

## II. FAQ
---

1. **Clicking the integration save button returns `authorize app first` error?**

   - Check if you've completed the app installation steps, such as whether you can see the `FlashDuty` app in your workspace
   - Verify if you've correctly configured the `Corp ID`

2. **How to complete account linking? Or message sending shows `App Not Linked`?**

   - Log into WeCom client (desktop or mobile), go to `Workspace`, find and enter the `FlashDuty` app
   - First-time access requires login, choose member account - password or SSO, successful login completes account linking between `Flashduty` and `WeCom`
   - Subsequent access will be passwordless

3. **How to send incident notifications?**

   - Must complete account linking as per Question 1 before sending notifications
   - Go to channel details page - escalation rule, select WeCom integration in personal channels to complete notification setup
   - Supports customizing WeCom notification content through template management page. Note: **Custom area supports maximum 8 lines**, excess content will be truncated by WeCom

4. **How to handle alerts in WeCom?**

   - Click the card message to directly access alert details
   - Click `Start Processing` to set alert status to `In Progress`
   - Click `Close Directly` to set alert status to `Closed`
   - Click `Snooze 2h` to snooze the alert for 2 hours, click `...` in top-right corner for more snooze options

5. **Why is there a `Refresh Status` button on card messages?**

   - WeCom limits card updates to once per 72 hours after interaction. Each button operation counts as an interaction
   - Flashduty requests card content updates when alert status changes
   - When alert status changes frequently, updates might fail due to update limit, use refresh button for one additional update opportunity

6. **How to open card messages in `System Default Browser` on Mac desktop?**

   - Mac desktop client defaults to internal browser for links
   - Try keyboard shortcut `ctrl` + `command` + `shift` + `d` to enable debug mode, then select `Debug - Browser & WebView Related - Open in System Browser` to change link opening behavior. Use the same shortcut to exit debug mode and retain settings

7. **Incident notification fails with `WeCom License Not Activated`?**

   - Contact Flashduty customer service or dedicated support for license purchase and activation
