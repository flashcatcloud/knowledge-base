3. Enter the integration name and click `Save`


## II. Common Issues
---

1. **Cannot find desired private channel in escalation rule channel list**
   - Adding the app to a channel requires Step 1 `Install App` to complete without errors
   - In the Slack channel, run `/invite @FlashDuty`. A message saying `has joined` or `has been added by xx to xxx` indicates successful addition

2. **Cannot find desired public channel in escalation rule channel list**
   - Add the app authorizer to the public channel
   - Or follow `Common Issue 1` to add the app to the channel

3. **Error when clicking Allow button in Step 2 of installation**
   - Try again, as there might be communication issues between the server and Slack causing authorization problems. Return to the add integration page and retry
   - If the error persists, contact customer support

4. **Error when clicking Save button in Step 3 of installation**
   - Try again, as there might be communication issues when FlashDuty attempts to obtain the permanent authorization code. Return to the add integration page and retry
   - If the error persists, contact customer support

5. **Slack App shows not_authed error**
   - Try again, as there might be issues with Slack service
   - If the error persists, contact customer support

6. **Slack App shows Operation timed out error**
   - Try again, as there might be communication timeout issues between the server and Slack
   - If the error persists, contact customer support

7. **Slack App shows This app responded with Status Code 500 error**
   - Try again, as there might be server errors, such as the integration being disabled
   - If the error persists, contact customer support

8. **Slack App shows Other questions error**
   - Try again, as this might be an unrecorded issue
   - If the error persists, contact customer support
