Through Jira Sync Webhook, you can associate and synchronize Flashduty incidents with Jira Issues, enabling integration between Flashduty and Jira.

## Prerequisites
- This integration is compatible with Jira Cloud, as well as versions 7.x and 8.x of Jira Server and Jira Data Center.
- Currently, only one-way synchronization of incident information and status to Jira is supported. Information in Jira will not sync back to Flashduty.
- For Jira Cloud, use an API Token in the password field during authorization configuration; for Jira Server or Data Center, use your Jira account password.

## Getting API Token in Jira Cloud （Jira Server and Data Center please skip）

- After logging into Jira Cloud, click your profile picture in the top right corner and select **Manage Account**.
- On the **Manage Account** page, select the **Security** tab.
- On the **Security** page, click **Create and manage API tokens**.
- In the **Create and manage API tokens** dialog, enter an API token name and select an expiration time.
- Click **Create** to generate the API token.
- Copy the API token value and paste it into the API token field in Flashduty's authorization configuration.

## Configuring Integration in Flashduty

### 1. Create and Authenticate Jira Integration
<div class="hide">

In the Integration Center, select **Webhook**, choose **Jira Sync** integration, and fill in the following authentication information.

</div>

- **Jira Platform Type**: Choose based on your version. For Data Center version, select Self-hosted (Server).
- **Service URL**: For Cloud version, enter your actual access URL, e.g., https://your-domain.atlassian.net. For Server version, enter your service access URL, e.g., https://your-jira-server-url.com.
- **Username**: Your Jira account name. For Cloud version, enter your email; for Server version, enter your Jira username.
- **API Token/Password**: Your Jira account credentials. For Cloud version, enter API Token; for Server version, enter your Jira account password.
- After completion, click **Next** to proceed with configuration.

**About Permissions**: Ensure your Jira account has permissions to access relevant projects, issue types, and create issues. Using an administrator account is recommended.

### 2. Jira Integration Configuration

- **Integration Name**: Define a name for this integration.
- **Trigger Mode**:
    - Automatic: Configure conditions for Flashduty to automatically sync qualifying incidents to Jira.
    - Manual: Manually trigger Jira sync from the incident details page's more actions menu (integration name serves as trigger name).
- **Project ID**: Select the target Jira project for synchronization.
- **Issue Type**: Select the target Jira issue type.
- **Channel**: Select the channel where this integration will be active. Only incidents within this channel can sync to Jira.
- **Severity Mapping**: If the selected issue type doesn't support priority fields, this mapping cannot be configured.
- **Custom Field Mapping**: Choose to sync certain or all incident labels and custom field content to Jira fields (text type fields only).

### 3. About Updates

- For incidents with existing Jira issues, updates to severity or status will automatically update in Jira, but Jira updates won't sync back to Flashduty.
- Comments sync to Jira, but Jira comments won't sync back to Flashduty.
- Updates to incident title, description, labels, or other fields won't update in Jira.

### 4. Flashduty to Jira Mapping

#### Field Mapping

| Jira | Flashduty |
| ---------- | -------- |
| Summary | Title |
| Description | Description |
| Priority | Severity |
| Reporter | Integration configured user |
| Comments | Comments |

#### Status Mapping

| Jira | Flashduty |
| ---------- | -------- |
| Todo | Pending |
| In Progress | In Progress |
| Done | Resolved |

### 5. Important Notes

- Flashduty syncs information according to default field mappings and your custom field configurations. If your Jira issue type has required fields without mapping relationships, Jira issue creation may fail.
- Jira issue details are accessed using project KEY + number format. If you modify the project KEY, saved issue URLs in Flashduty may become inaccessible, so please modify project KEYs with caution.
