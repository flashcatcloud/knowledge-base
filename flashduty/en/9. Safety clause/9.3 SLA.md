Last Updated: 2024-04-28

This Service Level Agreement (hereinafter referred to as "SLA") stipulates the service availability metrics and compensation plans for Flashduty services provided by Flashcat Cloud.

Please note that unless otherwise agreed, this agreement does not apply to Flashduty's beta, invitation-only, free features and versions, nor does it apply to Flashduty's on-premises version.

## How We Ensure SLA
---

1. **Multi-Active in Same City**: Infrastructure is built on multiple data centers, with stateful components all running in multi-active mode within the same city;
2. **Asynchronous Processing**: After an alert is reported, it immediately enters an asynchronous process with retry mechanisms, reducing the risk of alert loss;
3. **Redundant Notifications**: For critical alerts, redundant notification mechanisms are provided, allowing you to choose multiple channels for loop notification to ensure delivery;
4. **Global Acceleration**: Global acceleration is enabled for api.flashcat.cloud domain to ensure stable reporting from all locations;
5. **Continuous Monitoring**: Comprehensive collection of system metrics, regular stress testing to identify system issues proactively or in advance.

## Our SLA Commitment
---

- **Feature Availability (Error Rate)**: Core features are available 99.9% of the time
- **Delivery Timeliness (Delay Rate)**: 99.9% of alerts are delivered within 5 minutes of triggering

### Calculation Method

**Each 5-minute period is considered a cycle. If either the error rate or delay rate reaches 0.1% during this cycle, the cycle is considered to have failed to meet availability commitments.**

Specific definitions:

- **Service Period**: A complete service period is 30 days (not calendar month).
- **Total Minutes in Service Period**: Total days in service period * 24 (hours) * 60 (minutes).
- **Monthly Service Fee**: The total service fee paid for Flashduty services under a Flashcat Cloud account in one cycle. If you paid for multiple months at once, the monthly service fee will be calculated proportionally based on the number of months purchased or usage ratio.
- **Failed Requests**: Failed requests include:
    - Requests returning 500/502 status codes due to Flashduty system issues.
    - Requests that failed to reach Flashduty API servers due to Flashduty failures. When failed request numbers cannot be obtained due to Flashduty service failures, we calculate using the average of your per-minute Flashduty API service calls from the previous 7 calendar days, multiplied by the duration of the failure.
- **Valid Total Requests**: All requests received by Flashduty API servers are considered valid total requests.
- **Failed Notifications**: Failed notifications include:
    - Incident notifications not delivered due to Flashduty system issues
    - Incident notifications delayed over 5 minutes due to Flashduty system issues.
- **Valid Total Notifications**: All incidents triggered by Flashduty are considered valid total notifications.
- **Error Rate**: Number of failed requests per 5 minutes / Total valid requests per 5 minutes × 100%
- **Delay Rate**: Number of failed notifications per 5 minutes / Total valid notifications per 5 minutes × 100%

### Exclusions

Service unavailability due to the following reasons will not be counted as service unavailable time:

- System maintenance after prior notification from Flashcat Cloud, including cutover, maintenance, upgrades, and simulated failure drills;
- Network or equipment failures or configuration adjustments outside of Flashcat Cloud's equipment;
- Your application or data being compromised by hacker attacks;
- Data, account, or password loss due to your improper maintenance or confidentiality;
- Issues caused by your negligence or authorized operations;
- Issues caused by not following Flashcat Cloud's product documentation or usage recommendations;
- Delayed pushes due to carrier or terminal signal issues;
- Force majeure events.

## How to Apply for Compensation
---

### Compensation Standards

Compensation amounts are calculated based on the service availability of your Flashduty service under a Flashcat Cloud account, according to the following formula. Compensation is limited to bonus for purchasing Flashduty products, and the total compensation cannot exceed your monthly service fee (excluding fees covered by bonus) for the month when the service availability commitment was not met.

```
Compensation bonus amount = Minutes not meeting SLA * Per-minute rate of monthly service fee * 10
```

### Application Timeline

You can submit compensation applications for Flashduty services that didn't meet service availability commitments in the previous month after the fifth (5th) working day of each calendar month.

Compensation applications must be submitted within two (2) months after the end of the month when Flashduty failed to meet service availability commitments.
