An application represents a monitored frontend project, which can be a website, mobile application, or single-page application.\n\nWe recommend creating RUM applications based on business systems or applications, such as: official website, e-commerce platform, admin dashboard, etc.\n\nEach application has its own `applicationId` and `clientToken` to identify data sources and ensure data security. After creating an application, you need to integrate the SDK into your frontend code to begin data collection and monitoring.\n\n## Application Permissions\n\nTo meet special business requirements, RUM applications provide flexible permission management options (access levels), ensuring information is only visible to certain members or teams. Here are the two main permission settings:\n\n- **Public:** The application is visible to all users. All users can view the data collected by this application and handle issues under this application.\n- **Private:** Only the application creator, account administrators (Account Admin), and the owner account can view the data collected by this application. Other members who need to view the content can do so through shared incident links.\n\n## Creating an Application\n\n![2025-05-15-16-04-14](https://docs-cdn.flashcat.cloud/images/png/69baa5066dae4641adf1f769f3aacc54.png)\n\nYou can quickly create an application through the RUM product guidance page\n\n- **Application Type**: Choose the frontend technology type for your application. Currently supports `JavaScript (JS)`, `Android`, and `iOS`.\n- **Management Team**: Set the management team for the application. **Team members have full operational permissions for the application**, while non-creators have read-only access to the application's configuration.\n- **Geographic Information**: By default, automatic user data collection is enabled. If you need to disable automatic user data collection for client IP or geographic location data, turn off the geographic information collection switch. For details, see [RUM Browser Data Collection](https://docs.flashcat.cloud/en/flashduty/rum/data-collection?nav=01JCQ7A4N4WRWNXW8EWEHXCMF5).\n- **Alert Configuration**: By default, alert notifications are automatically enabled to help you promptly handle errors.

Through these metrics, you can understand the actual experience of users when visiting your website and make targeted optimizations.\n\n### Web Vitals Metrics Overview\n\nFlashduty RUM supports the following [Core Web Vitals metrics](https://web.dev/articles/vitals):\n\n- **Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)**: Measures the loading performance of the main content\n- **Interaction to Next Paint (INP)**: Measures overall interaction responsiveness\n- **Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)**: Measures visual stability\n- **First Contentful Paint (FCP)**: Measures the time of first content rendering\n\nIn addition to core metrics, it also supports other auxiliary metrics:\n\n- **First Input Delay (FID)**: Measures page interactivity\n- **Time to First Byte (TTFB)**: Measures server response speed\n\nThese metrics are automatically collected when users visit pages and reported to the Flashduty platform through the SDK. You can view detailed performance data in the analysis dashboard.\n\n:::tip\nInteraction to Next Paint and Largest Contentful Paint are not collected for pages opened in the background (for example, in a new tab or a window without focus).\n:::\n\n## Metric Calculation Methods\n\n### 1. Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)\n\n- **Calculation**: The time from page load start (`navigationStart`) to the rendering completion of the largest visible content element (such as images, text blocks).\n- **Use case**: Monitor loading speed of homepages or key pages, identify resource loading bottlenecks.\n\n### 2. First Contentful Paint (FCP)\n\n- **Calculation**: Measures the time from when a user first navigates to a page until any part of the page's content is rendered on the screen.\n- **Use case**: Used to measure perceived loading speed, helps reassure users that something is happening.\n\n### 3. Interaction to Next Paint (INP)\n\n- **Calculation**: Measures the delay time from all user interactions (clicks, taps, keyboard inputs) to the next frame rendering.\n- **Use case**: Evaluate overall interaction responsiveness of the page, optimize high-latency interaction scenarios.\n\n### 4. Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)\n\n- **Calculation**: Calculates the score of all unexpected layout shifts (shift distance × impact area).\n- **Use case**: Identify page jumps caused by dynamic content or advertisements.\n\n### 5. First Input Delay (FID)\n\n- **Calculation**: The time difference from the user's first interaction to when the browser processes the event.\n- **Use case**: Optimize response speed for interaction-intensive pages (such as forms, navigation menus).\n\n\n## Monitoring Single Page Applications (SPA)\n\nFor Single Page Applications (SPA), the RUM browser SDK distinguishes between two navigation types through the `loading_type` attribute: `initial_load` and `route_change`.\n\n1. History Single Page Applications\nIf an interaction on a webpage causes the URL to change but the page does not refresh completely, the RUM SDK will start a new `view` using `loading_type:route_change`. RUM uses the [History API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/History) to track URL changes.\n\n2. Hash Single Page Applications\nThe RUM SDK automatically monitors frameworks that rely on hash (`#`) navigation. The SDK listens for `HashChangeEvent` and issues a new `view`. Events from HTML anchors that do not affect the current view context are ignored.\n\nFor SPA applications, if you need to monitor performance after route changes, it is recommended to use the [Custom Performance Monitoring](#Custom%20Performance%20Monitoring) feature to measure performance metrics of specific components or interactions.\n\n## Custom Performance Monitoring\n\n### 1. Component-level Performance Measurement\n\nUse the `customVital` API to monitor the performance of specific components or interactions, suitable for:\n\n- Critical component rendering time.\n- User interaction response time.\n- Business process duration.\n\n#### Example: Measuring Component Rendering\n\n```javascript\n// Start timing\nconst ref = window.FC_RUM.startDurationVital(\"componentRendering\", {\n  description: \"login-form\",\n  context: { clientId: \"xxx\", componentVersion: \"1.0.0\" },\n});\n\n// End timing\nwindow.FC_RUM.stopDurationVital(ref);\n```\n\n#### Example: Directly Report Duration\n\n```javascript\nwindow.FC_RUM.addDurationVital(\"dropdownRendering\", {\n  startTime: 1707755888000, // UNIX timestamp (milliseconds)\n  duration: 10000, // Duration (milliseconds)\n});\n```\n\n### 2. Performance Timestamp Recording\n\nUse the `addTiming` API to record key timestamps, suitable for:\n\n- Loading of critical elements (such as first-screen images).\n- User's first interaction (such as first scroll).\n- Business node timestamps.\n\n#### Example: Recording First Scroll\n\n```javascript\ndocument.addEventListener(\"scroll\", function handler() {\n  document.removeEventListener(\"scroll\", handler);\n  window.FC_RUM.addTiming(\"first_scroll\");\n});\n```\n\n#### Example: Asynchronous Scenario\n\n```javascript\ndocument.addEventListener(\"scroll\", function handler() {\n  document.removeEventListener(\"scroll\", handler);\n  const timing = Date.now();\n  window.FC_RUM.onReady(() => {\n    window.FC_RUM.addTiming(\"first_scroll\", timing);\n  });\n});\n```\n\n## Considerations\n\n### 1. Naming Conventions\n\n- Avoid spaces and special characters in metric names.\n- Use descriptive naming (such as `login_form_render`).\n- Maintain naming consistency.\n\n### 2. Performance Impact Control\n\n- Control the number of custom metrics.\n- Avoid frequent timing.\n- Set sampling rates reasonably.\n\n## Common Issues\n\n### 1. Abnormal Page Loading Time\n\n- Check slowly loading resources (images, scripts).\n- Investigate third-party script blocking.\n- Analyze long-running JavaScript.\n\n### 2. Inaccurate Activity Status Determination\n\n- Confirm whether there are frequent background requests.\n- Check the handling of long connections or streaming requests.\n- Use `excludedActivityUrls` to exclude interference.\n\n### 3. Custom Metrics Issues\n\n- Verify that metric names comply with conventions.\n- Ensure timers are started and stopped correctly.\n- Check timestamp accuracy in asynchronous scenarios.\n\n### 4. Empty Web Vitals Metrics Collection\n\n- **Background pages**: Pages opened in new tabs or unfocused windows, causing INP and LCP to be uncollectable\n- **SPA route changes**: During `loading_type:route_change`, Core Web Vitals metrics (LCP, CLS, INP, FCP) will not be re-collected\n- **Integration method**: Page loads completely before SDK is fully initialized\n- **Page lifecycle**: Page is closed or navigated away before metrics collection is complete\n- **Browser compatibility**: Older browser versions do not support certain Web Vitals APIs\n- **Empty page content**: Page has no measurable content elements (such as blank pages)\n\n## Next Steps\n\n- [Performance Analysis](https://docs.flashcat.cloud/en/flashduty/rum/performance-analysis?nav=01JCQ7A4N4WRWNXW8EWEHXCMF5)\n- [Diagnosis and Optimization](https://docs.flashcat.cloud/en/flashduty/rum/performance-optimization?nav=01JCQ7A4N4WRWNXW8EWEHXCMF5) ",

Browser metrics, such as Core Web Vitals (CWV) and Flashduty custom loading time metrics, are used to troubleshoot slow page loading. These metrics assess the complete page loading time from the user's perspective.\n\nFor deeper analysis, the optimization page provides detailed breakdowns of Core Web Vitals by user demographics (such as browser, region, and application version). You can leverage this information to track performance trends, understand which user groups are most affected, and optimize precisely.\n\n## Diagnosis and Optimization\n\nYou can navigate to the Optimization page, located under the Performance Monitoring menu, and select the metric you want to analyze. You can also access this feature by viewing the corresponding performance data in the analysis dashboard.\n\n### Metric Selection\n\nAfter selecting a page and metric, you can begin to gain insights into performance data:\n\n1. Click on a metric card to select the metric to analyze (currently supports LCP, FCP, INP)\n\n2. Select a group in \"Show Filter Breakdown\"\n\n3. Evaluate metrics at different percentiles, for example, p75 evaluation represents the 75th percentile value.\n\n### Data Viewing\n\nYou can view how the metric performs under different conditions by adjusting the data grouping method or modifying filter conditions, thereby advancing the diagnosis and optimization work.\n\n![2025-05-19-19-29-55](https://docs-cdn.flashcat.cloud/images/png/65dd3ca92d67ae9175955502d91552dc.png)\n\n### Problem Diagnosis\n\nFirst, troubleshoot resources and errors. In the problem diagnosis section, you can see resources and errors that users encounter on the page that may affect metric performance. For example, for Largest Contentful Paint (LCP), you can view resources loaded before LCP is triggered. Since LCP is a metric of the time required for the largest element to load on the page, you can diagnose issues from both resource loading and error resolution perspectives.\n\n![2025-05-15-20-14-59](https://docs-cdn.flashcat.cloud/imges/png/279908df6509c39e433bd24a39df1ff2.png)\n\n**Optimize Resource Loading and Time Consumption**\n\n- You can view resource loading in this view, focusing on optimizing resources that take longer to load.\n- You can also check which resources cause rendering issues under the \"Blocking Resources\" panel.\n\n**Resolve Errors**\n\n- Focus on recurring errors that may cause problems, as these exceptions also affect page performance.\n\n### View Event Samples\n\nIf you cannot locate key information more accurately during the resource analysis phase, you can select appropriate event samples in the event sample block for more detailed context analysis.\n\n![2025-05-15-20-26-17](https://docs-cdn.flashcat.cloud/imges/png/04c160de32f11fd695e0a30cfca05af8.png)\n\nThe waterfall chart shows the timeline of events when the metric was captured. To view the context of the rest of the page activity, scroll down to the event line related to the event.\nYou can use the dropdown menu in the top left to select another sample event, and expand any event in the waterfall by clicking on it to view the side panel.\nYou can also select an appropriate set of events for problem analysis and diagnosis by filtering event types and various filter options.\n",

      "content": "---\ntitle: \"Distributed Tracing\"\ndescription: \"Learn how to configure and use distributed tracing features in Flashduty RUM to achieve complete monitoring of front-end and back-end request chains.\"\ndate: \"2024-09-09T10:00:00+08:00\"\nurl: \"https://docs.flashcat.cloud/en/flashduty/rum/distributed-tracing\"\n---\n\n## Overview\n\nFlashduty RUM's **Trace Tracking** feature deeply integrates front-end user monitoring with distributed tracing systems, allowing you to correlate web application requests with their corresponding backend traces. This combination enables you to view complete front-end and backend data at a glance, achieving end-to-end performance monitoring and issue troubleshooting.\n\nThrough Trace Tracking, you can:\n\n- **Correlate front-end and back-end requests**: Link front-end user operations with backend API calls\n- **End-to-end issue troubleshooting**: Quickly locate issues in the complete request chain from front-end to back-end\n- **Performance bottleneck analysis**: Identify performance bottlenecks throughout the entire request chain\n- **User experience optimization**: Optimize user experience based on complete request chain data\n\n## How It Works\n\nTrace tracking is implemented based on the [W3C Trace Context](https://www.w3.org/TR/trace-context/) standard, correlating front-end and back-end requests by injecting trace information into HTTP request headers:\n\n1. **Front-end initiates request**: The RUM SDK automatically adds trace header information to configured API requests\n2. **Back-end receives and processes**: Backend services receive and process requests with trace information\n3. **Chain correlation**: Front-end and back-end data are correlated through the same trace_id\n4. **Visual display**: View complete request chain information through trace correlation based on trace_id\n\n## Configuration Steps\n\n### 1. SDK Configuration\n\nFirst, you need to configure the distributed tracing feature in the RUM SDK. Based on the [RUM Advanced Configuration Documentation](https://docs.flashcat.cloud/en/flashduty/rum/advanced-configuration#integrating-rum-with-distributed-tracing), add the following parameters when initializing the RUM SDK:\n\n```javascript\nimport { flashcatRum } from \"@flashcatcloud/browser-rum\";\n\nflashcatRum.init({\n  applicationId: \"<YOUR_APPLICATION_ID>\", // Get from application management page\n  clientToken: \"<YOUR_CLIENT_TOKEN>\", // Get from application management page\n  service: \"<SERVICE_NAME>\", // Service name to distinguish different services\n  env: \"<ENV_NAME>\", // Environment identifier\n  version: \"1.0.0\", // Application version\n  sessionSampleRate: 100, // Sampling rate\n  allowedTracingUrls: [\n    \"https://api.example.com\",\n    /https:\\/\\/.*\\.my-api-domain\\.com/,\n    (url) => url.startsWith(\"https://api.example.com\"),\n  ], // List of URLs to track\n  traceSampleRate: 20, // Optional parameter, percentage of requests to trace: 100 for all, 0 for none. Default: 100\n});\n```\n\n#### Key Configuration Parameters\n\n- **`allowedTracingUrls`**: Specifies API endpoints that need trace information added\n\n  - **String**: Matches URLs starting with this value, e.g., `https://api.example.com`\n  - **Regular Expression**: Uses regex to match URLs\n  - **Function**: Custom matching logic, returns `true` for successful matches\n\n- **`traceSampleRate`**: Trace sampling rate, controls what percentage of requests are traced\n  - Range: 0-100\n  - Default: 100 (trace all requests)\n  - Recommendation: Set to 10-20 in production to balance monitoring coverage and performance\n\n### 2. Application Management Configuration\n\nAfter SDK configuration, you can configure trace jump settings in the application management page:\n\n1. Go to **Application Management** page\n2. Select the corresponding RUM application\n3. Configure the trace system jump address (if distributed tracing system is integrated)\n4. Enable **Trace Tracking** feature in **Advanced Configuration**\n   ::: tip\n   In the configured jump link, the system will automatically replace ${trace_id} with the actual trace_id.\n   :::\n\n![2025-09-09-15-40-22](https://docs-cdn.flashcat.cloud/imges/png/138f9f58afbdf3a532f4e7d1ed8748ff.png)\n\n### 3. Backend Service Configuration\n\nFor complete distributed tracing support, backend services need to:\n\n1. **Receive trace header information**: Process `traceparent` and `tracestate` request headers\n2. **Pass trace information**: Continue passing trace headers when calling other services\n3. **Generate trace data**: Record request processing into the tracing system\n\n## Trace Header Information\n\nThe RUM SDK automatically adds the following HTTP header information to configured requests:\n\n### traceparent Header\n\n```\ntraceparent: 00-00000000000000008448eb211c80319c-b7ad6b7169203331-01\n```\n\nFormat: `[version]-[trace-id]-[parent-id]-[trace-flags]`\n\n- **version**: Currently `00`\n- **trace-id**: 128-bit trace ID, 32 characters after hexadecimal processing\n- **parent-id**: 64-bit span ID, 16 characters after hexadecimal processing\n- **trace-flags**: Sampling flag, `01` indicates sampled, `00` indicates not sampled\n\n### tracestate Header\n\n```\ntracestate: dd=s:1;o:rum\n```\n\nFormat: `dd=s:[sampling-priority];o:[origin]`\n\n- **sampling-priority**: `1` indicates the trace is sampled\n- **origin**: Always `rum`, indicating collection through RUM SDK\n\n## Use Cases\n\n### 1. Viewing Traces in RUM Session Explorer\n\nAfter configuration, you can view corresponding trace information in the **View** section of the RUM Session Explorer:\n\n1. Go to **RUM Session Explorer**\n2. Select a page view containing API calls\n3. View **Trace Information** in the view details\n4. Click the trace link to jump to the trace system to view detailed request chains\n   ![2025-09-19-14-54-17](https://docs-cdn.flashcat.cloud/imges/png/6a34dfabea8e5ed490bd1ea2024581e6.png)\n\n### 2. Finding Resources by trace_id\n\nYou can also search for resources in the explorer using trace_id:\n\n1. Enter trace_id in the explorer search bar\n2. View corresponding resources and view loading conditions\n3. Analyze the correlation between resource loading performance and backend API calls\n   ![2025-09-09-16-03-45](https://docs-cdn.flashcat.cloud/imges/png/0c283dc836389e1a7a94103ed586aaa8.png)\n\n   ::: tip\n   You can also query corresponding resources directly by appending parameters to the URL. Example URL:\n   https://console.flashcat.cloud/rum/explorer?appid=${YOUR_APP_ID}&end=${END_TIME}&eventType=resource&queryStr=trace_id%3A${TRACE_ID}&start=${START_TIME}\n\n   Where start, end, and appid are optional parameters. If not provided, the current RUM default query application and time range will be reused. You can construct the URL according to your actual situation.\n   :::\n\n### 3. End-to-End Issue Troubleshooting\n\nWhen users report performance issues:\n\n1. Find the problematic user's session in the RUM Session Explorer\n2. View trace information for the problem page\n3. Jump to the trace system to view the complete request chain\n4. Determine whether it's a front-end, back-end, or network issue\n\n## Best Practices\n\n### 1. Reasonable Sampling Rate Configuration\n\n- **Development Environment**: Recommend setting to 100% to ensure all requests are traced\n- **Testing Environment**: Recommend setting to 50-80% to balance monitoring coverage and performance\n- **Production Environment**: Recommend setting to 10-20% to avoid performance impact\n\n### 2. Precise Tracing URL Configuration\n\n```javascript\n// Recommended: Precise API endpoint matching\nallowedTracingUrls: [\n  \"https://api.example.com/v1/\",\n  \"https://api.example.com/v2/\",\n];\n\n// Avoid: Overly broad matching\nallowedTracingUrls: [\n  \"https://api.example.com\", // May include static resources that don't need tracing\n];\n```\n\n### 3. Cross-Origin Request Handling\n\nIf your HTTP requests involve cross-origin issues, ensure:\n\n- Server is configured with correct CORS headers\n- Preflight requests are supported\n- `traceparent` and `tracestate` headers are allowed\n\n### 4. Performance Monitoring\n\n- Regularly check the impact of trace sampling rate on application performance\n- Monitor storage and query performance of trace data\n- Adjust tracing strategy based on business requirements\n\n## Common Issues\n\n### Q: Why don't some requests have trace information?\n\nA: Possible reasons include:\n\n- Request URL is not within the `allowedTracingUrls` configuration range\n- Request was filtered by `traceSampleRate` sampling rate\n- Request was initiated before SDK initialization\n- Cross-origin requests lack necessary CORS configuration\n\n### Q: How to verify if trace configuration is correct?\n\nA: You can verify through the following methods:\n\n1. Check network request headers in browser developer tools\n2. Confirm requests contain `traceparent` and `tracestate` headers\n3. Check if trace information is displayed in the RUM Session Explorer\n\n## Notes\n\n1. **Privacy Compliance**: Ensure trace data collection complies with relevant privacy regulations\n2. **Performance Impact**: Set reasonable sampling rates to avoid significant impact on application performance\n3. **Data Security**: Avoid including sensitive information in trace data\n4. **Cross-Origin Configuration**: Ensure backend services are properly configured with CORS to support trace headers\n\n## Related Documentation\n\n- [RUM Advanced Configuration](https://docs.flashcat.cloud/en/flashduty/rum/advanced-configuration) - Learn about complete RUM SDK configuration options\n- [RUM Session Explorer Overview](https://docs.flashcat.cloud/en/flashduty/rum/rum-explorer) - Master the use of RUM Session Explorer\n",

Each RUM event has all default properties, such as the URL of the page (`view_url`) and user information, like device type (`device_type`) and country (`geo_country`).\n\nThere are additional metrics and properties specific to a given event type. For example, the `view_loading_time` metric is associated with view events, while the `resource_method` property is associated with resource events.\n\n| Event Type | Retention Period | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |\n| ---------- | ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |\n| Session    | 30 days          | A user session begins when a user starts browsing a web application. It contains high-level information about the user (browser, device, geolocation). It aggregates all RUM events collected during the user journey, using a unique `session_id` attribute. Note: Sessions reset after 15 minutes of inactivity. |\n| View       | 30 days          | View events are generated each time a user visits a page in a web application. When a user stays on the same page, resource, long task, error, and action events are linked to the related RUM view, using the `view_id` attribute.                                                                                |\n| Resource   | 15 days          | Resource events are generated for images, XHR, Fetch, CSS, or JS libraries loaded on a webpage. They include detailed loading time information.                                                                                                                                                                    |\n| Long task  | 15 days          | Long task events are generated for any task that blocks the main thread in the browser for more than 50 milliseconds.                                                                                                                                                                                              |\n| Error      | 30 days          | RUM collects every frontend error emitted by the browser.

journey, and can also be sent manually to monitor custom user actions.                                                                                                                                                                                      |\n\nThe following hierarchical relationship exists between the above event types:\n\n<img

To protect user privacy and ensure data security, Flashduty provides various configuration options and tools to manage data collection, storage, and access.\n\n## Privacy Options\n\n### Client Token\n\nThe browser RUM client token is used to match data from end-user browsers with a specific RUM application in Flashduty. It is unencrypted and can be seen from the client side of the application.\n\nAlthough the client token is only used to send data to Flashduty and does not pose a risk of data leakage, we recommend the following good token management practices:\n\n- Regularly rotate client tokens to ensure they are only used by your application\n- Automatically filter out bots when capturing RUM data\n\n#### Authentication Proxy\n\nOne method to filter bots using client tokens is an authentication proxy. In this approach, a placeholder string is used instead of the `clientToken` when initializing the RUM SDK. The proxy knows the real client token, but the end user does not.\n\nThe proxy is configured to check for valid user information before passing session data to Flashduty, thus confirming that a real user is logged in and transmitting traffic to be monitored. When receiving traffic, the proxy verifies that the data contains the placeholder string and replaces it with the real `clientToken` before forwarding the data to Flashduty.\n\n### Event Tracking\n\nEvents are interactions between users and specific elements of your website or application. Events can be automatically captured through the SDK or sent through custom actions. You can turn off automatic tracking of user interactions and page visits, capturing only the interactions you choose. By default, RUM generates action names from actions automatically collected by the SDK using the target content. You can explicitly override this behavior with any given name.\n\n### Transmitting RUM Events Through a Proxy Server\n\nYou can transmit all RUM events through your own proxy server so that end-user devices never communicate directly with Flashduty.\n\n### User Identity Tracking\n\nBy default, **user identity is not tracked**. Each session has a unique `session.id` associated with it, which anonymizes the data but allows you to understand trends. You can choose to write code to capture user data (such as names and email addresses) and then use that data to enrich and modify RUM sessions, but this is not required.\n\n### Data Retention\n\nAfter configuring event capture, events are stored in Flashduty. You can decide how long captured events and properties are retained in Flashduty.\n\nBy default, the data retention period for production environments is:\n\n- 30 days for sessions, views, actions, errors, and session recordings\n- 15 days for resources and long tasks\n\n### Removal of Personal and Sensitive Data\n\nYou can use multiple options to remove personally identifiable information (PII) and sensitive data, including IP addresses and geolocation information. Some scenarios where PII might appear in RUM include:\n\n- Action names on buttons (for example, \"View Full Credit Card Number\")\n- Names displayed in URLs\n- Custom tracking events set by application developers\n\n#### Masking Action Names\n\nBy default, if you want to mask all action names, you can use the `enablePrivacyForActionName` option in combination with the `mask` privacy setting. This automatically replaces all action names that have not been overridden with the placeholder `Masked Element`. This setting is also designed to be compatible with existing HTML override attributes.\n\n#### IP Address\n\nAfter initializing a RUM application, you can choose whether to include IP or geolocation data in the **User Data Collection** tab.\n\nWhen IP data collection is disabled, the change takes effect immediately. Any events collected before disabling will not have IP data removed. This is performed on the backend, meaning the browser SDK still sends the data, but the IP address is omitted and discarded by the Flashduty backend pipeline during processing.\n\n#### Geolocation\n\nIn addition to removing client IPs, you can also choose to disable the collection of geolocation (country, city, county) or GeoIP information from all future collected data. If you uncheck the **Collect Geolocation Data** box, the change takes effect immediately. Any events collected before disabling will not have the corresponding geolocation data removed. Data omission is done at the backend level, meaning the browser SDK still sends the data, but geolocation data is omitted and discarded by the Flashduty backend pipeline during processing. ",

You can also add custom attributes to extend the default data set.\n\n## Application Startup\n\nFlashcat collects the following metrics from app startup:\n\n| Metric                      | Description                                                                                                 |\n| --------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| **cold_start_duration**     | Cold start duration: time from app process creation to first Activity rendering completion.                 |\n| **warm_start_duration**     | Warm start duration: app process already exists, time from Activity start to rendering completion.          |\n| **hot_start_duration**      | Hot start duration: both app and Activity are in memory, time from Activity resume to rendering completion. |\n| **activity_start_duration** | Activity start duration: time from `onCreate` to first frame rendering completion.                          |\n| **is_pre_warmed**           | Boolean indicating whether the app was started through pre-warming (Android 11+).                           |\n\nStartup type descriptions:\n\n- **Cold start**: First launch of the app or launch after process termination. Requires loading all resources and initializing app state.\n- **Warm start**: App process is in memory, but Activity needs to be recreated.\n- **Hot start**: Both app and Activity are in memory, only need to bring Activity to foreground.\n\n## View Monitoring and App Lifecycle\n\nA View represents a unique screen that users see in the app. Each View start creates a new RUM event, which is updated throughout the View's lifecycle. Views collect information about all resources, actions, errors, and long tasks that occur during their lifecycle.\n\nIn Android, Activities and Fragments are considered Views. By default, the SDK uses the following strategies to automatically track Views:\n\n- **ActivityViewTrackingStrategy**: Tracks each Activity as a View based on Activity lifecycle.\n- **FragmentViewTrackingStrategy**: Tracks each Fragment as a View based on Fragment lifecycle.\n- **MixedViewTrackingStrategy**: Tracks both Activities and Fragments simultaneously.\n- **NavigationViewTrackingStrategy**: Tracking strategy for Jetpack Navigation component.\n\nYou can also manually call `RumMonitor.startView()` and `RumMonitor.stopView()` to customize View tracking.\n\n## Default Attributes\n\nFlashcat RUM SDK attaches the following default attributes to all events. These attributes help you understand user device, network status, and app context.\n\n### Common Core Attributes\n\n| Attribute Name        | Type   | Description

This cache folder is protected by Android app sandboxing, meaning that on most devices, other apps cannot read this data. However, if the mobile device is rooted or someone tampers with the Linux kernel, stored data may become readable.\n\n**Storage location**: `/data/data/<package_name>/cache/com.flashcat.rum/`\n\n**Note**: Sensitive data should not be included in RUM events, or should be obfuscated or filtered before sending through the `beforeSend` callback.\n\n## Data Upload\n\nFlashcat RUM Android SDK considers user bandwidth impact while ensuring data transmission. The SDK uploads events in batches as follows:\n\n### Batching Mechanism\n\n1. **When collecting events**:  \n   Flashcat SDK appends uncompressed events to batch files (using TLV encoding format, Tag-Length-Value).\n\n2. **When uploading** (when a batch is considered \"closed\"):\n   - Read batch file and extract events\n   - Deduplicate RUM events (remove redundant View events; other traces are not optimized)\n   - Build trace-specific payloads\n   - Compress payloads and send\n\n### Upload Trigger Conditions\n\nBatches are uploaded under the following conditions:\n\n- Batch file size reaches threshold (e.g., 4MB)\n- Number of events in batch reaches threshold\n- App switches to background\n- Periodic upload (e.g., every 5 seconds)\n\n### Upload Strategy\n\n- **When network is available**: Prioritize upload via WiFi, mobile network also supported.\n- **When battery is sufficient**: Ensure not to excessively consume device battery.\n- **Retry on failure**: If upload fails, batches are retained locally until successfully sent.\n\n### Data Compression\n\nBefore upload, Flashcat SDK performs gzip compression on batch data to reduce network traffic and upload time.\n\n## Direct Boot Mode Support\n\nIf your app supports Direct Boot mode (starts before device unlock), note that data captured before device unlock will **not be recorded** as credential encrypted storage is not yet available.\n\nFlashcat SDK will start collecting data after device unlock. If you need to collect data in Direct Boot mode, ensure device encrypted storage is used instead of credential encrypted storage.\n\n## Further Reading\n\n- [Android SDK Integration Guide](https://docs.flashcat.cloud/en/flashduty/rum/android-sdk-integration): Learn how to integrate the Android SDK\n- [Android SDK Advanced Configuration](https://docs.flashcat.cloud/en/flashduty/rum/android-advanced-configuration): Learn how to configure advanced SDK features\n- [RUM Analysis Dashboard](https://docs.flashcat.cloud/en/flashduty/rum/analysis-dashboard): View and analyze RUM data\n",

By integrating the SDK, you can monitor your Android application's performance, errors, and user behavior in real-time.\n\n## Integration Steps\n\n### Step 1: Add SDK Dependencies\n\nAdd the Flashcat SDK dependencies to your app module's `build.gradle` file:\n\n```groovy\ndependencies {\n    implementation \"cloud.flashcat:fc-sdk-android-core:0.1.0\"\n    implementation \"cloud.flashcat:fc-sdk-android-rum:0.1.0\"\n}\n```\n\n### Step 2: Retrieve Application Information from the Console\n\nIn the **RUM Application Management** page of the Flashcat console:\n\n1. Create or select an Android application\n2. Obtain the following information:\n   - **Application ID**: Application unique identifier\n   - **Client Token**: Client access token\n     ![2026-01-14-19-57-20](https://docs-cdn.flashcat.cloud/imges/png/68ee9835732aad09e4e134f30bd2cccd.png)\n\n### Step 3: Initialize SDK with Application Context\n\nInitialize the Flashcat SDK in the `onCreate()` method of your `Application` class:\n\n```kotlin\nimport cloud.flashcat.android.Flashcat\nimport cloud.flashcat.android.FlashcatSite\nimport cloud.flashcat.android.core.configuration.Configuration\nimport cloud.flashcat.android.privacy.TrackingConsent\n\nclass SampleApplication : Application() {\n    override fun onCreate() {\n        super.onCreate()\n\n        val clientToken = \"<CLIENT_TOKEN>\"\n        val environmentName = \"<ENV_NAME>\"\n        val appVariantName = \"<APP_VARIANT_NAME>\"\n\n        val configuration = Configuration.Builder(\n            clientToken = clientToken,\n            env = environmentName,\n            variant = appVariantName\n        )\n            .build()\n\n        Flashcat.initialize(this, configuration, TrackingConsent.GRANTED)\n    }\n}\n```\n\nDuring initialization, you need to set the environment name (`environmentName`) and app variant name (`appVariantName`). The `appVariantName` specifies which application variant generates the data. For more configuration options, see [Advanced Configuration](https://docs.flashcat.cloud/en/flashduty/rum/android-advanced-configuration).\n\n### Step 4: Enable RUM Features and Start Sending Data\n\nConfigure and enable the RUM features of the Android SDK:\n\n```kotlin\nimport cloud.flashcat.android.rum.Rum\nimport cloud.flashcat.android.rum.RumConfiguration\nimport cloud.flashcat.android.rum.tracking.ActivityViewTrackingStrategy\n\nval rumConfig = RumConfiguration.Builder(applicationId)\n    .trackUserInteractions()\n    .trackLongTasks(durationThreshold)\n    .useViewTrackingStrategy(ActivityViewTrackingStrategy(true))\n    .build()\nRum.enable(rumConfig)\n```\n\n### Step 5: Initialize Interceptors to Track Network Events\n\nTo initialize interceptors for tracking network events:\n\n1. **Enable Trace Functionality**: Add and enable the Trace feature\n2. **Add Dependencies**: Add the `fc-sdk-android-okhttp` library dependency to your module-level `build.gradle` file:\n\n```groovy\ndependencies {\n    implementation \"cloud.flashcat:fc-sdk-android-okhttp:0.1.0\"\n}\n```\n\n3. **Add Interceptor**: Configure the interceptor provided by Flashcat to track OkHttp requests (currently using the community Datadog http interceptor).\n\n```kotlin\nimport cloud.flashcat.android.okhttp.DatadogInterceptor\nimport cloud.flashcat.android.trace.TracingHeaderType\n\nval tracedHostsWithHeaderType = mapOf(\n    \"example.com\" to setOf(\n        TracingHeaderType.DATADOG, // datadog protocol\n        TracingHeaderType.TRACECONTEXT // w3c standard protocol\n    ),\n    \"api.example.com\" to setOf(\n        TracingHeaderType.DATADOG,\n        TracingHeaderType.TRACECONTEXT\n    )\n)\n\nval okHttpClient = OkHttpClient.Builder()\n    .addInterceptor(DatadogInterceptor.Builder(tracedHostsWithHeaderType).build())\n    .build()\n```\n\n4. **Automatically Create Resources and Spans**: When using `DatadogInterceptor` as an interceptor, every request handled by OkHttpClient is automatically recorded as a resource, with related information (URL, method, status code, error) automatically populated. **Note**: Only network requests initiated when a view is active will be tracked. To track requests when the app is in the background, see [Track Background Events](#track-background-events).\n\n5. **Track Network Redirects or Retries**: To monitor network redirects or retries, you can use `DatadogInterceptor` as a network interceptor:\n\n```kotlin\nval okHttpClient = OkHttpClient.Builder()\n    .addNetworkInterceptor(DatadogInterceptor.Builder(tracedHostsWithHeaderType).build())\n    .build()\n```\n\n**Note**:\n\n- If using multiple interceptors, add `DatadogInterceptor` as the first interceptor\n\nYou can also add an `EventListener` to your `OkHttpClient` to automatically track resource timing for third-party providers and network requests.\n\n#### Filter Specific Errors\n\nTo filter specific errors reported by `DatadogInterceptor`, configure a custom `EventMapper` in the `RumConfiguration`:\n\n```kotlin\nval rumConfig = RumConfiguration.Builder(applicationId)\n    .setErrorEventMapper { errorEvent ->\n        if (errorEvent.shouldBeDiscarded()) {\n            null\n        } else {\n            errorEvent\n        }\n    }\n    .build()\n```\n\n## Track Background Events\n\nYou can track events that occur when the application is running in the background (such as crashes and network requests).\n\nAdd the following code during configuration:\n\n```kotlin\nval rumConfig = RumConfiguration.Builder(applicationId)\n    // ...\n    .trackBackgroundEvents(true)\n    .build()\n```\n\n**Note**: Tracking background events may generate additional sessions, which could affect billing. If you have questions, please contact the Flashcat support team.\n\n## Send Data When Device is Offline\n\nThe Android SDK ensures data availability when the user's device is offline. In cases of weak network signals or low device battery, all events are first stored in batches on the local device.\n\nEach batch follows the data intake specification. Batches are sent as soon as the network becomes available and the battery is sufficient, ensuring the Flashcat SDK doesn't affect the end-user experience. If the network is unavailable while the app is running in the foreground, or if data upload fails, the batch is retained until it is successfully sent.\n\nThis means that even if users open your app while offline, no data is lost. To ensure the SDK doesn't use too much disk space, old data on disk is automatically discarded.\n\n### Track Local Resource Access\n\nYou can track access to assets resources using the `getAssetAsRumResource` extension method:\n\n```kotlin\nval inputStream = context.getAssetAsRumResource(fileName)\n```\n\nTrack usage of raw resources using the `getRawResAsRumResource` extension method:\n\n```kotlin\nval inputStream = context.getRawResAsRumResource(id)\n```\n\n## WebView Integration\n\nIf your Android application includes WebView, you can enable WebView tracking in the following way:\n\n### Add WebView Dependencies\n\n```groovy\ndependencies {\n    implementation \"cloud.flashcat:fc-sdk-android-webview:0.1.0\"\n}\n```\n\n### Enable WebView Tracking\n\nEnable WebView tracking in your Activity or Fragment:\n\n```kotlin\nimport cloud.flashcat.android.webview.WebViewTracking\n\n// Enable tracking for the specified WebView\nWebViewTracking.enable(webView, listOf(\"example.com\", \"*.example.com\"))\n```\n\n**Parameter Description:**\n\n- `webView`: The WebView instance to track\n- `allowedHosts`: List of allowed domains for tracking, supports wildcards\n\nThis way, web pages in your WebView can be associated with native app RUM data.\n\n## Verify Integration\n\nAfter integration is complete, you can verify successful integration through the following steps:\n\n1. **Access Console**: Log in to the console and navigate to the corresponding RUM application to check if data is being reported\n2. **Trigger Test Events**:\n   - Open different pages of the app to verify page view events\n   - Perform user operations (clicks, swipes, etc.) to verify interaction events\n   - Trigger network requests to verify resource loading events\n3. **Check Data Reporting Address**: Check Logcat for network requests to the data reporting endpoint\n\n## Obfuscation Configuration\n\nIf your application has code obfuscation enabled (ProGuard/R8), add the following rules to your `proguard-rules.pro` file:\n\n```proguard\n# Flashcat SDK\n-keep class cloud.flashcat.android.** { *; }\n-dontwarn cloud.flashcat.android.**\n```\n\n## Further Reading\n\n- [RUM Application Management](https://docs.flashcat.cloud/en/flashduty/rum/application-management): Learn how to create and manage RUM applications\n- [Android SDK Advanced Configuration](https://docs.flashcat.cloud/en/flashduty/rum/android-advanced-configuration): Learn how to configure SDK advanced features\n- [RUM Analysis Dashboard](https://docs.flashcat.cloud/en/flashduty/rum/native-analysis-dashboard): View and analyze RUM data\n",

You can also manually send custom RUM views when a view becomes visible or interactive:\n\n```kotlin\nimport cloud.flashcat.android.rum.GlobalRum\n\nfun onResume() {\n    GlobalRum.get().startView(viewKey, viewName, attributes)\n}\n\nfun onPause() {\n    GlobalRum.get().stopView(viewKey, attributes)\n}\n```\n\n```java\nimport cloud.flashcat.android.rum.GlobalRum;\n\npublic void onResume() {\n    GlobalRum.get().startView(viewKey, viewName, attributes);\n}\n\npublic void onPause() {\n    GlobalRum.get().stopView(viewKey, attributes);\n}\n```\n\n**Parameter descriptions:**\n\n- `viewKey` (String): Unique identifier for the view. The same `viewKey` is used for both `startView()` and `stopView()` calls\n- `viewName` (String): Name of the view\n- `attributes` (Map<String, Any?>): Attributes attached to the view, optional\n\n### Custom Actions\n\nBesides automatically tracked user interactions, you can also track specific custom user actions (such as taps, swipes, likes):\n\n```kotlin\nimport cloud.flashcat.android.rum.GlobalRum\nimport cloud.flashcat.android.rum.RumActionType\n\nfun onUserInteraction() {\n    GlobalRum.get().addAction(\n        RumActionType.TAP,\n        name,\n        attributes\n    )\n}\n```\n\n```java\nimport cloud.flashcat.android.rum.GlobalRum;\nimport cloud.flashcat.android.rum.RumActionType;\n\npublic void onUserInteraction() {\n    GlobalRum.get().addAction(\n        RumActionType.TAP,\n        name,\n        attributes\n    );\n}\n```\n\n**RumActionType options:**\n\n- `RumActionType.TAP`: Tap action\n- `RumActionType.SCROLL`: Scroll action\n- `RumActionType.SWIPE`: Swipe action\n- `RumActionType.CLICK`: Click action\n- `RumActionType.CUSTOM`: Custom action\n\n### Custom Resources\n\nBesides automatically tracked resources, you can also manually track specific custom resources (such as network requests, third-party library loading):\n\n```kotlin\nimport cloud.flashcat.android.rum.GlobalRum\nimport cloud.flashcat.android.rum.RumResourceKind\n\nfun loadResource() {\n    GlobalRum.get().startResource(\n        resourceKey,\n        method,\n        url,\n        attributes\n    )\n}\n\nfun resourceLoadSuccess() {\n    GlobalRum.get().stopResource(\n        resourceKey,\n        statusCode,\n        size,\n        RumResourceKind.NATIVE,\n        attributes\n    )\n}\n\nfun resourceLoadError() {\n    GlobalRum.get().stopResourceWithError(\n        resourceKey,\n        statusCode,\n        message,\n        source,\n        throwable\n    )\n}\n```\n\n```java\nimport cloud.flashcat.android.rum.GlobalRum;\nimport cloud.flashcat.android.rum.RumResourceKind;\n\npublic void loadResource() {\n    GlobalRum.get().startResource(\n        resourceKey,\n        method,\n        url,\n        attributes\n    );\n}\n\npublic void resourceLoadSuccess() {\n    GlobalRum.get().stopResource(\n        resourceKey,\n        statusCode,\n        size,\n        RumResourceKind.NATIVE,\n        attributes\n    );\n}\n\npublic void resourceLoadError() {\n    GlobalRum.get().stopResourceWithError(\n        resourceKey,\n        statusCode,\n        message,\n        source,\n        throwable\n    );\n}\n```\n\n**RumResourceKind options:**\n\n- `RumResourceKind.BEACON`: Beacon request\n- `RumResourceKind.FETCH`: Fetch request\n- `RumResourceKind.XHR`: XHR request\n- `RumResourceKind.DOCUMENT`: Document resource\n- `RumResourceKind.IMAGE`: Image resource\n- `RumResourceKind.JS`: JavaScript resource\n- `RumResourceKind.FONT`: Font resource\n- `RumResourceKind.CSS`: CSS resource\n- `RumResourceKind.MEDIA`: Media resource\n- `RumResourceKind.OTHER`: Other resource\n- `RumResourceKind.NATIVE`: Native resource\n\n### Custom Errors\n\nTo log specific errors, notify the RUM SDK when an exception occurs:\n\n```kotlin\nimport cloud.flashcat.android.rum.GlobalRum\n\nGlobalRum.get().addError(\n    message,\n    source,\n    throwable,\n    attributes\n)\n```\n\n```java\nimport cloud.flashcat.android.rum.GlobalRum;\n\nGlobalRum.get().addError(\n    message,\n    source,\n    throwable,\n    attributes\n);\n```\n\n**RumErrorSource options:**\n\n- `RumErrorSource.NETWORK`: Network error\n- `RumErrorSource.SOURCE`: Source code error\n- `RumErrorSource.CONSOLE`: Console error\n- `RumErrorSource.LOGGER`: Logger error\n- `RumErrorSource.AGENT`: Agent error\n- `RumErrorSource.WEBVIEW`: WebView error\n- `RumErrorSource.CUSTOM`: Custom error\n\n### Custom Timing\n\nBesides RUM SDK's default performance metrics, you can also use the `addTiming` API to measure time spent in your app. Timings are relative offsets from the current RUM view start time.\n\nFor example, you can time how long it takes to display a hero image:\n\n```kotlin\nimport cloud.flashcat.android.rum.GlobalRum\n\nfun onHeroImageLoaded() {\n    GlobalRum.get().addTiming(\"hero_image\")\n}\n```\n\n```java\nimport cloud.flashcat.android.rum.GlobalRum;\n\npublic void onHeroImageLoaded() {\n    GlobalRum.get().addTiming(\"hero_image\");\n}\n```\n\nOnce the timing is set, it can be accessed via `@view.custom_timings.<timing_name>`, for example `@view.custom_timings.hero_image`.\n\n### Adding User Attributes\n\nRUM SDK automatically tracks user attributes. You can also add additional custom user attributes, such as user plan, user group, etc:\n\n```kotlin\nimport cloud.flashcat.android.rum.GlobalRum\n\nGlobalRum.get().setUserInfo(\n    id = \"1234\",\n    name = \"John Doe\",\n    email = \"john@doe.com\",\n    extraInfo = mapOf(\n        \"plan\" to \"premium\",\n        \"group\" to \"vip\"\n    )\n)\n```\n\n```java\nimport cloud.flashcat.android.rum.GlobalRum;\nimport java.util.HashMap;\nimport java.util.Map;\n\nMap<String, Object> extraInfo = new HashMap<>();\nextraInfo.put(\"plan\", \"premium\");\nextraInfo.put(\"group\", \"vip\");\n\nGlobalRum.get().setUserInfo(\n    \"1234\",\n    \"John Doe\",\n    \"john@doe.com\",\n    extraInfo\n);\n```\n\n## Event and Data Management\n\n### Clear All Data\n\nUse `clearAllData` to clear all unsent data currently stored in the SDK:\n\n```kotlin\nimport cloud.flashcat.android.Flashcat\n\nFlashcat.clearAllData()\n```\n\n```java\nimport cloud.flashcat.android.Flashcat;\n\nFlashcat.clearAllData();\n```\n\n### Stop Data Collection\n\nUse `stopInstance` to stop collecting data and clear all local data:\n\n```kotlin\nimport cloud.flashcat.android.Flashcat\n\nFlashcat.stopInstance()\n```\n\n```java\nimport cloud.flashcat.android.Flashcat;\n\nFlashcat.stopInstance();\n```\n\n### Control Event Batch Upload\n\nRUM SDK automatically batches event uploads. You can control batch upload behavior through configuration parameters:\n\n```kotlin\nimport cloud.flashcat.android.core.configuration.Configuration\nimport cloud.flashcat.android.core.configuration.UploadFrequency\n\nval configuration = Configuration.Builder(\n    clientToken = clientToken,\n    env = environmentName,\n    variant = appVariantName\n)\n    .setBatchSize(batchSize)\n    .setUploadFrequency(UploadFrequency.FREQUENT)\n    .build()\n```\n\n```java\nimport cloud.flashcat.android.core.configuration.Configuration;\nimport cloud.flashcat.android.core.configuration.UploadFrequency;\n\nConfiguration configuration = new Configuration.Builder(clientToken, environmentName, appVariantName)\n    .setBatchSize(batchSize)\n    .setUploadFrequency(UploadFrequency.FREQUENT)\n    .build();\n```\n\n**UploadFrequency options:**\n\n- `UploadFrequency.FREQUENT`: Frequent upload\n- `UploadFrequency.AVERAGE`: Average upload (default)\n- `UploadFrequency.RARE`: Rare upload\n\n### Set Remote Log Threshold\n\nYou can define a minimum log level for remotely recorded messages. Logs below this level will not be sent to Flashcat:\n\n```kotlin\nimport cloud.flashcat.android.log.Logs\nimport cloud.flashcat.android.log.LogsConfiguration\nimport android.util.Log\n\nval logsConfig = LogsConfiguration.Builder()\n    .setRemoteSampleRate(100f)\n    .setRemoteLogThreshold(Log.WARN)\n    .build()\nLogs.enable(logsConfig)\n```\n\n```java\nimport cloud.flashcat.android.log.Logs;\nimport cloud.flashcat.android.log.LogsConfiguration;\nimport android.util.Log;\n\nLogsConfiguration logsConfig = new LogsConfiguration.Builder()\n    .setRemoteSampleRate(100f)\n    .setRemoteLogThreshold(Log.WARN)\n    .build();\nLogs.enable(logsConfig);\n```\n\n## Tracking Custom Global Attributes\n\nBesides default attributes automatically captured by the RUM SDK, you can add additional contextual information to RUM events, such as custom attributes. Custom attributes allow you to filter and group observed user behavior based on code-level information (such as shopping cart status, merchant tier, advertising campaign).\n\n### Tracking User Sessions\n\nAdding user information to RUM sessions allows you to:\n\n- Track browsing paths of specific users\n- Understand which users are most affected by errors\n- Monitor performance for key users\n\nThe following attributes are optional, but you should provide at least one:\n\n- `id` (String): Unique user identifier\n- `name` (String): User-friendly name, displayed by default in RUM UI\n- `email` (String): User email, displayed if no name is provided\n\nTo identify user sessions, use the `setUserInfo` API after SDK initialization:\n\n```kotlin\nimport cloud.flashcat.android.rum.GlobalRum\n\nGlobalRum.get().setUserInfo(\n    id = \"1234\",\n    name = \"John Doe\",\n    email = \"john@doe.com\"\n)\n```\n\n```java\nimport cloud.flashcat.android.rum.GlobalRum;\n\nGlobalRum.get().setUserInfo(\"1234\", \"John Doe\", \"john@doe.com\", null);\n```\n\n### Tracking Attributes\n\n#### Add Global Attributes\n\n```kotlin\nimport cloud.flashcat.android.rum.GlobalRum\n\nGlobalRum.get().addAttribute(\"key\", \"value\")\n```\n\n```java\nimport cloud.flashcat.android.rum.GlobalRum;\n\nGlobalRum.get().addAttribute(\"key\", \"value\");\n```\n\n#### Remove Global Attributes\n\n```kotlin\nimport cloud.flashcat.android.rum.GlobalRum\n\nGlobalRum.get().removeAttribute(\"key\")\n```\n\n```java\nimport cloud.flashcat.android.rum.GlobalRum;\n\nGlobalRum.get().removeAttribute(\"key\");\n```\n\n## Tracking Widgets\n\nWidgets are not automatically tracked. To manually send interactions from Widget UI, you can call the Flashcat API:\n\n```kotlin\nimport cloud.flashcat.android.rum.GlobalRum\n\nfun onWidgetClicked() {\n    GlobalRum.get().addAction(\n        RumActionType.TAP,\n        \"widget_clicked\",\n        mapOf(\"widget_name\" to \"HomeWidget\")\n    )\n}\n```\n\n```java\nimport cloud.flashcat.android.rum.GlobalRum;\nimport java.util.HashMap;\nimport java.util.Map;\n\npublic void onWidgetClicked() {\n    Map<String, Object> attributes = new HashMap<>();\n    attributes.put(\"widget_name\", \"HomeWidget\");\n    GlobalRum.get().addAction(\n        RumActionType.TAP,\n        \"widget_clicked\",\n        attributes\n    );\n}\n```\n\n## Initialization Parameters\n\nWhen initializing the Flashcat Android SDK, you can configure the SDK using the following methods in `Configuration.Builder`:\n\n### Automatically Track Views\n\nTo automatically track views (Activities, Fragments), use `useViewTrackingStrategy` during initialization:\n\n```kotlin\nimport cloud.flashcat.android.rum.RumConfiguration\nimport cloud.flashcat.android.rum.tracking.ActivityViewTrackingStrategy\n\nval rumConfig = RumConfiguration.Builder(applicationId)\n    .useViewTrackingStrategy(ActivityViewTrackingStrategy(true))\n    .build()\n```\n\n```java\nimport cloud.flashcat.android.rum.RumConfiguration;\nimport cloud.flashcat.android.rum.tracking.ActivityViewTrackingStrategy;\n\nRumConfiguration rumConfig = new RumConfiguration.Builder(applicationId)\n    .useViewTrackingStrategy(new ActivityViewTrackingStrategy(true))\n    .build();\n```\n\n**Available tracking strategies:**\n\n- `ActivityViewTrackingStrategy(trackExtras)`: Track each Activity as a separate view. The `trackExtras` parameter determines whether to track Activity Intent extras\n- `FragmentViewTrackingStrategy(trackArguments)`: Track each Fragment as a separate view. The `trackArguments` parameter determines whether to track Fragment arguments\n- `MixedViewTrackingStrategy(trackExtras, trackArguments)`: Track both Activities and Fragments. Track both Activity and Fragment as separate views\n- `NavigationViewTrackingStrategy(navigationViewId)`: For Android Navigation component. Track navigation destinations as views\n\n### Automatically Track Network Requests\n\nTo automatically track network requests, refer to the OkHttp interceptor configuration in the [SDK Integration Guide](./1.%20SDK%20Integration.md#step-5-initialize-interceptors-to-track-network-events).\n\n#### Automatically Track Apollo GraphQL Requests\n\nIf you're using the Apollo GraphQL client for network calls, you can enable automatic tracking by following these steps:\n\n**Step 1**: Add the `fc-sdk-android-apollo` dependency to your app's `build.gradle` file:\n\n```groovy\ndependencies {\n    implementation \"cloud.flashcat:fc-sdk-android-apollo:x.x.x\"\n}\n```\n\n**Step 2**: Add the Flashcat interceptor to your Apollo Client configuration:\n\n```kotlin\nimport com.apollographql.apollo.ApolloClient\nimport com.apollographql.apollo.network.okHttpClient\nimport cloud.flashcat.android.apollo.FlashcatApolloInterceptor\n\nval apolloClient = ApolloClient.Builder()\n    .serverUrl(\"GraphQL endpoint\")\n    .addInterceptor(FlashcatApolloInterceptor())\n    .okHttpClient(okHttpClient)\n    .build()\n```\n\n```java\nimport com.apollographql.apollo.ApolloClient;\nimport cloud.flashcat.android.apollo.FlashcatApolloInterceptor;\n\nApolloClient apolloClient = new ApolloClient.Builder()\n    .serverUrl(\"GraphQL endpoint\")\n    .addInterceptor(new FlashcatApolloInterceptor())\n    .okHttpClient(okHttpClient)\n    .build();\n```\n\nThis will automatically add Flashcat tracing headers to your GraphQL requests, enabling them to be tracked by Flashcat.\n\n**Note:**\n\n- This integration only supports Apollo version `4`\n- Only `query` and `mutation` type operations are tracked, not `subscription` operations\n- GraphQL payload sending is disabled by default. To enable, set the `sendGraphQLPayloads` flag in the `FlashcatApolloInterceptor` constructor:\n\n```kotlin\nFlashcatApolloInterceptor(sendGraphQLPayloads = true)\n```\n\n```java\nnew FlashcatApolloInterceptor(true)\n```\n\n### Automatically Track Long Tasks\n\nLong-running operations on the main thread can impact your app's visual performance and responsiveness. To track these operations, define a duration threshold for when a task is considered too long:\n\n```kotlin\nimport cloud.flashcat.android.rum.RumConfiguration\n\nval rumConfig = RumConfiguration.Builder(applicationId)\n    .trackLongTasks(durationThreshold)\n    .build()\n```\n\n```java\nimport cloud.flashcat.android.rum.RumConfiguration;\n\nRumConfiguration rumConfig = new RumConfiguration.Builder(applicationId)\n    .trackLongTasks(durationThreshold)\n    .build();\n```\n\nFor example, to replace the default `100 ms` duration, you can set a custom threshold in the configuration:\n\n```kotlin\nval rumConfig = RumConfiguration.Builder(applicationId)\n    .trackLongTasks(250L) // Track tasks exceeding 250ms as long tasks\n    .build()\n```\n\n```java\nRumConfiguration rumConfig = new RumConfiguration.Builder(applicationId)\n    .trackLongTasks(250L) // Track tasks exceeding 250ms as long tasks\n    .build();\n```\n\n## Modifying or Dropping RUM Events\n\nTo modify certain attributes of RUM events before batch processing, or to completely drop certain events, provide an implementation of `EventMapper<T>` when initializing the RUM Android SDK:\n\n```kotlin\nimport cloud.flashcat.android.rum.RumConfiguration\n\nval rumConfig = RumConfiguration.Builder(applicationId)\n    .setErrorEventMapper(rumErrorEventMapper)\n    .setActionEventMapper(rumActionEventMapper)\n    .setResourceEventMapper(rumResourceEventMapper)\n    .setViewEventMapper(rumViewEventMapper)\n    .setLongTaskEventMapper(rumLongTaskEventMapper)\n    .build()\n```\n\n```java\nimport cloud.flashcat.android.rum.RumConfiguration;\n\nRumConfiguration rumConfig = new RumConfiguration.Builder(applicationId)\n    .setErrorEventMapper(rumErrorEventMapper)\n    .setActionEventMapper(rumActionEventMapper)\n    .setResourceEventMapper(rumResourceEventMapper)\n    .setViewEventMapper(rumViewEventMapper)\n    .setLongTaskEventMapper(rumLongTaskEventMapper)\n    .build();\n```\n\nWhen implementing the `EventMapper<T>` interface, only some attributes can be modified for each event type:\n\n| Event Type    | Modifiable Attribute Keys | Description                     |\n| ------------- | ------------------------- | ------------------------------- |\n| ViewEvent     | `view.referrer`           | URL linking to the initial view |\n|               | `view.url`                | URL of the view                 |\n|               | `view.name`               | Name of the view                |\n| ActionEvent   | `action.target.name`      | Target name                     |\n|               | `view.referrer`           | URL linking to the initial view |\n|               | `view.url`                | URL of the view                 |\n|               | `view.name`               | Name of the view                |\n| ErrorEvent    | `error.message`           | Error message                   |\n|               | `error.stack`             | Stack trace of the error        |\n|               | `error.resource.url`      | URL of the resource             |\n|               | `view.referrer`           | URL linking to the initial view |\n|               | `view.url`                | URL of the view                 |\n|               | `view.name`               | Name of the view                |\n| ResourceEvent | `resource.url`            | URL of the resource             |\n|               | `view.referrer`           | URL linking to the initial view |\n|               | `view.url`                | URL of the view                 |\n|               | `view.name`               | Name of the view                |\n| LongTaskEvent | `view.referrer`           | URL linking to the initial view |\n|               | `view.url`                | URL of the view                 |\n|               | `view.name`               | Name of the view                |\n\n**Note:** If you return `null` from the `EventMapper<T>` implementation, the event will remain unchanged and be sent as is.\n\n### Example: Dropping Sensitive Errors\n\n```kotlin\nval rumConfig = RumConfiguration.Builder(applicationId)\n    .setErrorEventMapper { errorEvent ->\n        if (errorEvent.error.message?.contains(\"sensitive_data\") == true) {\n            null // Drop errors containing sensitive data\n        } else {\n            errorEvent\n        }\n    }\n    .build()\n```\n\n```java\nRumConfiguration rumConfig = new RumConfiguration.Builder(applicationId)\n    .setErrorEventMapper(errorEvent -> {\n        if (errorEvent.error.message != null &&\n            errorEvent.error.message.contains(\"sensitive_data\")) {\n            return null; // Drop errors containing sensitive data\n        } else {\n            return errorEvent;\n        }\n    })\n    .build();\n```\n\n## Getting RUM Session ID\n\nRetrieving the RUM Session ID is helpful for troubleshooting. For example, you can attach the Session ID to support requests, emails, or error reports so that support teams can later find user sessions in Flashcat.\n\nYou can access the RUM Session ID at runtime without waiting for the `sessionStarted` event:\n\n```kotlin\nimport cloud.flashcat.android.rum.GlobalRum\n\nGlobalRum.get().getCurrentSessionId { sessionId ->\n    currentSessionId = sessionId\n}\n```\n\n```java\nimport cloud.flashcat.android.rum.GlobalRum;\n\nGlobalRum.get().getCurrentSessionId(sessionId -> {\n    currentSessionId = sessionId;\n});\n```\n\n## Sampling\n\nBy default, Flashcat RUM collects data for all sessions. You can reduce the number of sessions collected by setting a sampling rate (percentage) using the `sessionSampleRate` parameter at initialization:\n\n```kotlin\nimport cloud.flashcat.android.rum.RumConfiguration\n\nval rumConfig = RumConfiguration.Builder(applicationId)\n    .setSessionSampleRate(90.0f) // Collect 90% of sessions\n    .build()\n```\n\n```java\nimport cloud.flashcat.android.rum.RumConfiguration;\n\nRumConfiguration rumConfig = new RumConfiguration.Builder(applicationId)\n    .setSessionSampleRate(90.0f) // Collect 90% of sessions\n    .build();\n```\n\nSampled sessions will not collect any page views and their associated telemetry data.\n\n## User Tracking Consent\n\nTo comply with privacy regulations such as GDPR and CCPA, Flashcat RUM allows setting user tracking consent status at initialization. Options:\n\n- `TrackingConsent.GRANTED`: Start collecting data and send to Flashcat\n- `TrackingConsent.NOT_GRANTED`: Do not collect any data\n- `TrackingConsent.PENDING`: Start collecting data but do not send to Flashcat\n\nIf initialized with `TrackingConsent.PENDING`, the SDK will start collecting data, but will not send it until the consent status changes to `TrackingConsent.GRANTED`.\n\nYou can change the consent status after initialization through the `setTrackingConsent` API:\n\n```kotlin\nimport cloud.flashcat.android.Flashcat\nimport cloud.flashcat.android.privacy.TrackingConsent\n\nFlashcat.setTrackingConsent(TrackingConsent.GRANTED)\n```\n\n```java\nimport cloud.flashcat.android.Flashcat;\nimport cloud.flashcat.android.privacy.TrackingConsent;\n\nFlashcat.setTrackingConsent(TrackingConsent.GRANTED);\n```\n\n## Notes\n\n- Ensure `startView` and `stopView` are called in appropriate lifecycle methods to avoid duplicate view tracking\n- When using custom resource tracking, ensure each `startResource` has a corresponding `stopResource` or `stopResourceWithError` call\n- When modifying events, only attributes listed in the table above can be modified; modifications to other attributes will be ignored\n- Reasonably set sampling rate and batch upload frequency to balance data volume and performance overhead\n\n## Further Reading\n\n- [Android SDK Integration Guide](./1.%20SDK%20Integration.md): Learn how to integrate the Android RUM SDK\n- [Android Data Collection](./3.%20Data%20Collection.md): Learn about the data types and content collected by the SDK\n- [RUM Application Management](../../1.%20Getting%20Started/4.%20Application%20Management.md): Learn how to create and manage RUM applications\n",

Each RUM event includes default attributes, such as the UIViewController class URL corresponding to the event (`view.url`) and user information like device type (`device.type`) and country (`geo.country`).\n\nAdditionally, different event types have specific additional metrics and attributes. For example, the `view.time_spent` metric is associated with view events, while the `resource.method` attribute is associated with resource events.\n\n## Application Startup\n\nDuring app startup, the iOS SDK records app startup time and creates a corresponding view. Startup time is measured as the interval from process launch to the first `applicationDidBecomeActive` notification.\n\n| Attribute             | Type                 | Description                                                             |\n| --------------------- | -------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| `view.is_start_view`  | Boolean              | Indicates whether this view is the initial view created at app startup. |\n| `action.type`         | String               | Type of app startup action, value is `application_start`.               |\n| `action.loading_time` | Number (nanoseconds) | Time required for app startup.                                          |\n\n## View Monitoring and App Lifecycle\n\nIn iOS apps, views are automatically created when users visit different screens. A view starts recording when the user opens a screen and stops when the view is no longer visible (e.g., user opens another screen).\n\nWhen a view stops, the SDK doesn't immediately end its lifecycle but keeps it in `inactive` state for a period to attach subsequent events. If a new view starts during this period, the previous view will fully end. If no new view starts, the previous view will resume to `active` state.\n\nWhen the app enters background, the SDK retains the last active view and monitors any new background events. Background time is not counted in the active view's `time_spent` metric. However, if the user immediately returns to the app, the SDK resumes the original `time_spent` measurement.\n\n## Default Attributes\n\nFlashcat iOS RUM SDK automatically captures the following default attributes, which apply to all RUM event types.\n\n### Common Core Attributes\n\n| Attribute        | Type    | Description                                                            |\n| ---------------- | ------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| `date`           | Integer | Event timestamp (in milliseconds).                                     |\n| `type`           | String  | Event type (such as `session`, `view`, `resource`, `error`, `action`). |\n| `service`        | String  | Service name that generated this event.                                |\n| `application.id` | String  | Unique identifier for the application.                                 |\n\n### Device\n\nThe following device-related attributes are automatically attached to all events collected by Flashcat:\n\n| Attribute      | Type   | Description                                                         |\n| -------------- | ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| `device.type`  | String | Device type (such as `Mobile`, `Tablet`, `TV`, `Desktop`, `Other`). |\n| `device.brand` | String | Device brand, `Apple` for iOS devices.                              |\n| `device.model` | String | Device model (such as `iPhone`, `iPad`, `iPod Touch`, `Apple TV`).  |\n| `device.name`  | String | Name of the device.                                                 |\n\n### Operating System\n\nThe following OS-related attributes are automatically attached to all events collected by Flashcat:\n\n| Attribute          | Type   | Description                                              |\n| ------------------ | ------ | -------------------------------------------------------- |\n| `os.name`          | String | Operating system name (such as `iOS`, `iPadOS`, `tvOS`). |\n| `os.version`       | String | OS version number (such as `15.4.1`, `16.0`).            |\n| `os.version_major` | String | OS major version number (such as `15`, `16`).            |\n\n### Network Connectivity\n\nThe following network-related attributes are automatically attached to resource and error events:\n\n| Attribute                            | Type         | Description                                                                 |\n| ------------------------------------ | ------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| `connectivity.status`                | String       | Device network connection status (such as `connected`, `not_connected`).    |\n| `connectivity.interfaces`            | String array | Available network interface types (such as `wifi`, `cellular`, `ethernet`). |\n| `connectivity.cellular.technology`   | String       | Cellular network technology type (such as `3G`, `4G`, `LTE`, `5G`).         |\n| `connectivity.cellular.carrier_name` | String       | Cellular network carrier name.                                              |\n\n### Geolocation\n\nThe following attributes relate to the geographic location of the IP address:\n\n| Attribute                 | Type   | Description                                                                                |\n| ------------------------- | ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |\n| `geo.country`             | String | Country name.                                                                              |\n| `geo.country_iso_code`    | String | Country ISO code (such as `US`, `CN`).                                                     |\n| `geo.country_subdivision` | String | First-level administrative division of the country (such as US states, Chinese provinces). |\n| `geo.continent_code`      | String | Continent ISO code (such as `EU`, `AS`).                                                   |\n| `geo.continent`           | String | Continent name.                                                                            |\n| `geo.city`                | String | City name.                                                                                 |\n\n### Global User Attributes\n\nYou can enable user tracking on all RUM events to correlate user sessions and simplify troubleshooting.

By integrating the SDK, you can monitor your iOS application's performance, errors, and user behavior in real-time.\n\n## Integration Steps\n\n### Step 1: Add SDK Dependencies\n\nFlashcat iOS SDK supports installation via Swift Package Manager.\n\n1. In Xcode, open your project and select **File > Add Package Dependencies**\n2. Enter the Flashcat SDK Git repository URL in the search bar:\n   ```\n   https://github.com/flashcat-cloud/fc-ios-sdk\n   ```\n3. Select the desired version or branch\n4. In **Add to Target**, select your application target\n5. Add the following package dependencies:\n   - `FlashcatCore`: Core SDK\n   - `FlashcatRUM`: RUM functionality module\n\n### Step 2: Retrieve Application Information from the Console\n\nIn the **RUM Application Management** page of the Flashcat console:\n\n1. Create or select an iOS application\n2. Obtain the following information:\n   - **Application ID**: Application unique identifier\n   - **Client Token**: Client access token\n\n### Step 3: Initialize SDK\n\nInitialize the Flashcat SDK in the `application(_:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:)` method of your `AppDelegate.swift`:\n\n```swift\nimport UIKit\nimport FlashcatCore\n\n@main\nclass AppDelegate: UIResponder, UIApplicationDelegate {\n    func application(_ application: UIApplication, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [UIApplication.LaunchOptionsKey: Any]?) -> Bool {\n\n        Flashcat.initialize(\n            with: Flashcat.Configuration(\n                clientToken: \"<CLIENT_TOKEN>\",\n                env: \"<ENV_NAME>\",\n            ),\n            trackingConsent: .granted\n        )\n\n        return true\n    }\n}\n```\n\n#### Initialization Parameters\n\n- **clientToken**: Client token retrieved from the Flashcat console (required)\n- **env**: Environment name, such as `production`, `staging` (required)\n- **site**: Data reporting site, options: `.us1`, `.us3`, `.us5`, `.eu1`, `.ap1` (required)\n- **trackingConsent**: User tracking consent status, options:\n  - `.pending`: SDK starts collecting and batching data but does not send to Flashcat, waiting for new tracking consent value\n  - `.granted`: SDK starts collecting data and sending to Flashcat\n  - `.notGranted`: SDK does not collect any data\n\nYou can dynamically modify the tracking consent status after initialization through `Flashcat.set(trackingConsent:)`.\n\n### Step 4: Enable RUM Features and Start Sending Data\n\nConfigure and enable RUM features. It is recommended to enable them as early as possible in `AppDelegate`:\n\n```swift\nimport FlashcatRUM\n\nRUM.enable(\n    with: RUM.Configuration(\n        applicationID: \"<RUM_APPLICATION_ID>\",\n        uiKitViewsPredicate: DefaultUIKitRUMViewsPredicate(),\n        uiKitActionsPredicate: DefaultUIKitRUMActionsPredicate(),\n        swiftUIViewsPredicate: DefaultSwiftUIRUMViewsPredicate(),\n        swiftUIActionsPredicate: DefaultSwiftUIRUMActionsPredicate(isLegacyDetectionEnabled: true),\n        urlSessionTracking: RUM.Configuration.URLSessionTracking()\n    )\n)\n```\n\n#### RUM Configuration Parameters\n\n- **applicationID**: RUM application ID retrieved from the console\n- **uiKitViewsPredicate**: UIKit view tracking strategy\n- **uiKitActionsPredicate**: UIKit user action tracking strategy\n- **swiftUIViewsPredicate**: SwiftUI view tracking strategy\n- **swiftUIActionsPredicate**: SwiftUI user action tracking strategy\n- **urlSessionTracking**: URLSession network request tracking configuration\n\n### Step 5: Track Network Events\n\n#### Enable URLSession Tracking\n\nTo monitor network requests sent from `URLSession` instances, you need to enable `URLSessionInstrumentation` and pass in your delegate class type:\n\n```swift\nimport FlashcatRUM\n\nURLSessionInstrumentation.enable(\n    with: .init(\n        delegateClass: YourSessionDelegate.self\n    )\n)\n\nlet session = URLSession(\n    configuration: .default,\n    delegate: YourSessionDelegate(),\n    delegateQueue: nil\n)\n```\n\nAfter configuration, the SDK automatically tracks all network requests, including:\n\n- Request URL, method, status code\n- Request and response header information\n- Request duration and data size\n- Network error information\n\n**Note**: Only network requests initiated when a view is active will be tracked.\n\n## View Tracking\n\nFlashcat iOS SDK supports automatic tracking of UIKit and SwiftUI views.\n\n### UIKit View Automatic Tracking\n\nUIKit views are automatically tracked through the default `DefaultUIKitRUMViewsPredicate`. The SDK tracks the lifecycle of `UIViewController`, automatically recording view display and hiding.\n\n### SwiftUI View Tracking\n\nFor SwiftUI applications, you need to manually add tracking code to the view:\n\n```swift\nimport SwiftUI\nimport FlashcatRUM\n\nstruct ProductView: View {\n    var body: some View {\n        VStack {\n            Text(\"Product Details\")\n            // Your view content\n        }\n        .trackRUMView(name: \"Product\")\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThe `trackRUMView(name:)` method automatically starts and stops view tracking when the SwiftUI view appears and disappears.\n\n### Custom View Tracking\n\nIf you need more fine-grained control, you can manually track views:\n\n```swift\nimport FlashcatRUM\n\n// Start tracking a view\nRUMMonitor.shared().startView(key: \"view-key\", name: \"View Name\", attributes: [:])\n\n// Stop tracking a view\nRUMMonitor.shared().stopView(key: \"view-key\", attributes: [:])\n```\n\n## User Action Tracking\n\n### UIKit Action Automatic Tracking\n\nUser actions in UIKit (such as button clicks, switch toggles, etc.) are automatically tracked through `DefaultUIKitRUMActionsPredicate`.\n\n### SwiftUI Action Tracking\n\nFor SwiftUI controls, you can add the `.trackRUMTapAction(name:)` modifier:\n\n```swift\nimport SwiftUI\nimport FlashcatRUM\n\nstruct CheckoutView: View {\n    var body: some View {\n        Button(\"Complete Purchase\") {\n            // Button action\n        }\n        .trackRUMTapAction(name: \"Purchase\")\n    }\n}\n```\n\n**Note**: Using `.trackRUMTapAction(name:)` inside `List` may affect default gestures (for example, disabling `Button` actions or breaking `NavigationLink`). For `List` elements, it is recommended to use the custom action API.\n\n### Custom Action Tracking\n\nManually track user actions:\n\n```swift\nimport FlashcatRUM\n\nRUMMonitor.shared().addAction(\n    type: .tap,\n    name: \"Button Tapped\",\n    attributes: [\"button_id\": \"submit\"]\n)\n```\n\n## Track iOS Errors\n\nFlashcat iOS SDK automatically captures application crashes and uncaught exceptions. You can also manually record errors:\n\n```swift\nimport FlashcatRUM\n\nRUMMonitor.shared().addError(\n    message: \"Network request failed\",\n    type: \"NetworkError\",\n    source: .network,\n    attributes: [\n        \"url\": \"https://api.example.com\",\n        \"status_code\": 500\n    ]\n)\n```\n\nAll error information will be displayed in the RUM Explorer of the Flashcat console, including error stack, attributes, and JSON details.\n\n## Track Background Events\n\nYou can track events that occur when the application is running in the background (such as crashes and network requests).\n\nAdd the following code when configuring RUM:\n\n```swift\nRUM.enable(\n    with: RUM.Configuration(\n        applicationID: \"<RUM_APPLICATION_ID>\",\n        trackBackgroundEvents: true\n    )\n)\n```\n\n## Track User Information\n\nYou can set user information for the current session:\n\n```swift\nimport FlashcatCore\n\nFlashcat.setUserInfo(\n    id: \"user-123\",\n    name: \"John Doe\",\n    email: \"john.doe@example.com\",\n    extraInfo: [\n        \"plan\": \"premium\",\n        \"signup_date\": \"2024-01-15\"\n    ]\n)\n```\n\n## Send Data When Device is Offline\n\nThe iOS SDK ensures data availability when the user's device is offline. In cases of weak network signals or low device battery, all events are first stored in batches on the local device.\n\nBatches are sent as soon as the network becomes available and the battery is sufficient, ensuring the Flashcat SDK doesn't affect the end-user experience. If the network is unavailable while the app is running in the foreground, or if data upload fails, the batch is retained until it is successfully sent.\n\nThis means that even if users open your app while offline, no data is lost. To ensure the SDK doesn't use too much disk space, old data on disk is automatically discarded.\n\n## WebView Integration\n\nIf your iOS application includes WKWebView, you can enable WebView tracking in the following way:\n\n### Add WebView Dependencies\n\n#### Swift Package Manager\n\nWhen adding package dependencies, also add the `FlashcatWebView` module.\n\n### Enable WebView Tracking\n\nEnable WebView tracking in your ViewController:\n\n```swift\nimport FlashcatWebView\nimport WebKit\n\nlet webView = WKWebView()\n\n// Enable tracking for the specified WKWebView\nWebViewTracking.enable(webView: webView, hosts: [\"example.com\", \"*.example.com\"])\n```\n\n**Parameter Description:**\n\n- `webView`: The WKWebView instance to track\n- `hosts`: List of allowed domains for tracking, supports wildcards\n\nThis way, web pages in your WebView can be associated with native app RUM data.\n\n## Disable Automatic User Data Collection\n\nTo comply with privacy regulations or organizational data governance policies, you may need to disable automatic user data collection.\n\nTo disable automatic collection of client IP or geographic location data:\n\n1. After creating the application, navigate to the **Application Management** page and click on your application\n2. Click **User Data Collection**\n3. Use the switches to control these settings\n\n## Verify Integration\n\nAfter integration is complete, you can verify successful integration through the following steps:\n\n1. **Check Console Logs**: Search for the `Flashcat` keyword in the Xcode console to view SDK initialization and data reporting logs\n2. **Access Console**: Log in to the Flashcat console and navigate to the corresponding RUM application to check if data is being reported\n3. **Trigger Test Events**:\n   - Open different pages of the app to verify page view events\n   - Perform user operations (clicks, swipes, etc.) to verify interaction events\n   - Trigger network requests to verify resource loading events\n   - Manually trigger an error to verify error tracking\n\n## Supported Versions\n\nFlashcat iOS SDK supports the following platforms and versions:\n\n- **iOS**: 12.0 and above\n- **iPadOS**: 12.0 and above\n- **tvOS**: 12.0 and above\n- **macOS**: 10.14 and above (Mac Catalyst)\n\n**Language Support**:\n\n- Swift 5.0 and above\n- Objective-C\n\n## Further Reading\n\n- [RUM Application Management](https://docs.flashcat.cloud/en/flashduty/rum/application-management): Learn how to create and manage RUM applications\n- [iOS SDK Advanced Configuration](https://docs.flashcat.cloud/en/flashduty/rum/ios-advanced-configuration): Learn how to configure SDK advanced features\n- [RUM Analysis Dashboard](https://docs.flashcat.cloud/en/flashduty/rum/analysis-dashboard): View and analyze RUM data\n- [Track iOS Errors](https://docs.flashcat.cloud/en/flashduty/rum/ios-error-tracking): Learn how to track and debug iOS errors\n- [SwiftUI Application Monitoring](https://docs.flashcat.cloud/en/flashduty/rum/swiftui-monitoring): Learn how to monitor SwiftUI applications\n",

If you want to manually track specific views or add custom time and attributes to automatically tracked views, you can use the APIs provided by the RUM iOS SDK.\n\n#### Manually Starting and Stopping Views\n\nCall `RUMMonitor.shared().startView(key:name:attributes:)` to start tracking a new RUM view. All views with the same `key` will be grouped in the RUM Explorer.\n\nWhen the view is no longer visible, call `RUMMonitor.shared().stopView(key:attributes:)` to stop tracking.\n\n```swift\nimport FlashcatRUM\n\n// in your `UIViewController`:\noverride func viewDidAppear(_ animated: Bool) {\n    super.viewDidAppear(animated)\n    RUMMonitor.shared().startView(\n        key: \"view-key\",\n        name: \"View Name\",\n        attributes: [\"foo\": \"bar\"]\n    )\n}\n\noverride func viewDidDisappear(_ animated: Bool) {\n    super.viewDidDisappear(animated)\n    RUMMonitor.shared().stopView(\n        key: \"view-key\",\n        attributes: [\"foo\": \"bar\"]\n    )\n}\n```\n\n```objective-c\n@import FlashcatObjc;\n// in your `UIViewController`:\n\n- (void)viewDidAppear:(BOOL)animated {\n    [super viewDidAppear:animated];\n\n    [[RUMMonitor shared] startViewWithKey:@\"view-key\" name:@\"View Name\" attributes:@{@\"foo\": @\"bar\"}];\n}\n\n- (void)viewDidDisappear:(BOOL)animated {\n    [super viewDidDisappear:animated];\n\n    [[RUMMonitor shared] stopViewWithKey:@\"view-key\" attributes:@{@\"foo\": @\"bar\"}];\n}\n```\n\n### Custom Actions\n\nBesides automatically tracking user actions, you can also manually track specific custom actions (such as taps, scrolls, swipes, etc.) using `RUMMonitor.shared().addAction(type:name:attributes:)`:\n\n```swift\nimport FlashcatRUM\n\n// in your `UIViewController`:\n@IBAction func didTapDownloadResourceButton(_ sender: UIButton) {\n    RUMMonitor.shared().addAction(\n        type: .tap,\n        name: sender.currentTitle ?? \"\",\n        attributes: [\"resource_id\": \"123\"]\n    )\n}\n```\n\n```objective-c\n@import FlashcatObjc;\n\n- (IBAction)didTapDownloadResourceButton:(UIButton *)sender {\n    [[RUMMonitor shared] addActionWithType:RUMActionTypeTap name:sender.currentTitle attributes:@{@\"resource_id\": @\"123\"}];\n}\n```\n\n**Note**: When using `RUMMonitor.shared().addAction(type:name:attributes:)`, the RUM SDK creates a RUM action and attaches all new resources, errors, and long tasks to this action until the view is considered fully loaded.\n\n### Custom Resources\n\nFlashcat iOS SDK automatically tracks network requests initiated through enabled `URLSession`. If you want to manually track custom resources (such as network requests, third-party provider APIs, GraphQL queries, etc.), you can use the following methods:\n\nCall `RUMMonitor.shared().startResource(resourceKey:request:attributes:)` to start loading a resource, then call `RUMMonitor.shared().stopResource(resourceKey:response:size:attributes:)` when loading completes, or call `RUMMonitor.shared().stopResourceWithError(resourceKey:error:attributes:)` when loading fails:\n\n```swift\nimport FlashcatRUM\n\n// in your network client:\nRUMMonitor.shared().startResource(\n    resourceKey: \"resource-key\",\n    request: request,\n    attributes: [\"foo\": \"bar\"]\n)\n\nRUMMonitor.shared().stopResource(\n    resourceKey: \"resource-key\",\n    response: response,\n    size: size,\n    attributes: [\"foo\": \"bar\"]\n)\n```\n\n```objective-c\n@import FlashcatObjc;\n\n// in your network client:\n[[RUMMonitor shared] startResourceWithResourceKey:@\"resource-key\" request:request attributes:@{@\"foo\": @\"bar\"}];\n\n[[RUMMonitor shared] stopResourceWithResourceKey:@\"resource-key\" response:response size:size attributes:@{@\"foo\": @\"bar\"}];\n```\n\n**Note**: The `resourceKey` used in both calls must be unique for the RUM iOS SDK to match the resource start with its completion.\n\n### Custom Errors\n\nTo track specific errors, notify `RUMMonitor` when an error occurs:\n\n```swift\nimport FlashcatRUM\n\nRUMMonitor.shared().addError(\n    message: \"Error message\",\n    type: \"ErrorType\",\n    source: .source,\n    stack: \"Error stack trace\",\n    attributes: [\n        \"foo\": \"bar\"\n    ],\n    file: #file,\n    line: #line\n)\n```\n\n```objective-c\n@import FlashcatObjc;\n\n[[RUMMonitor shared] addErrorWithMessage:@\"Error message\"\n                                    type:@\"ErrorType\"\n                                  source:DDRUMErrorSourceCustom\n                                   stack:@\"Error stack trace\"\n                              attributes:@{@\"foo\": @\"bar\"}\n                                    file:file\n                                    line:line];\n```\n\n## Tracking Custom Global Attributes\n\nFlashcat iOS SDK automatically captures [default RUM attributes](https://docs.flashcat.cloud/en/flashduty/rum/data-collection). Additionally, you can add extra contextual information to RUM events, such as custom attributes.\n\nCustom attributes enable you to filter and group observed user behavior information based on code-level information (such as shopping cart value, merchant tier, or advertising campaign).\n\n### Setting Custom Global Attributes\n\nTo set custom global attributes, use `RUMMonitor.shared().addAttribute(forKey:value:)`:\n\n```swift\nimport FlashcatRUM\n\nRUMMonitor.shared().addAttribute(forKey: \"user_plan\", value: \"premium\")\n```\n\n```objective-c\n@import FlashcatObjc;\n\n[[RUMMonitor shared] addAttributeForKey:@\"user_plan\" value:@\"premium\"];\n```\n\n**Note**: You cannot use the following key names as they are used internally by the SDK: `date`, `error.kind`, `error.message`, `error.stack`, `error.source_type`, `view.id`, `view.url`, `view.loading_time`, `view.referrer`, `application.id`.\n\nTo remove a custom global attribute, use `RUMMonitor.shared().removeAttribute(forKey:)`:\n\n```swift\nimport FlashcatRUM\n\nRUMMonitor.shared().removeAttribute(forKey: \"user_plan\")\n```\n\n```objective-c\n@import FlashcatObjc;\n\n[[RUMMonitor shared] removeAttributeForKey:@\"user_plan\"];\n```\n\n## Tracking User Sessions\n\nAdding user information to RUM sessions allows you to:\n\n- Track browsing paths of specific users\n- Understand which users are most affected by errors\n- Monitor performance for key users\n\nThe following attributes are **optional**, and you should provide **at least one**:\n\n- `usr.id` (string): Unique user identifier\n- `usr.name` (string): User-friendly name, displayed by default in RUM UI\n- `usr.email` (string): User email, displayed if no name is provided\n\nTo identify user sessions, use `Flashcat.setUserInfo(id:name:email:extraInfo:)` after SDK initialization:\n\n```swift\nimport FlashcatCore\n\nFlashcat.setUserInfo(\n    id: \"1234\",\n    name: \"John Doe\",\n    email: \"john@doe.com\",\n    extraInfo: [\n        \"plan\": \"premium\",\n        \"signup_date\": \"2024-01-15\"\n    ]\n)\n```\n\n```objective-c\n@import FlashcatObjc;\n\n[Flashcat setUserInfoWithId:@\"1234\"\n                       name:@\"John Doe\"\n                      email:@\"john@doe.com\"\n                  extraInfo:@{@\"plan\": @\"premium\", @\"signup_date\": @\"2024-01-15\"}];\n```\n\n## Tracking Background Events\n\nYou can track events when the app is running in the background (such as crashes and network requests).\n\nAdd the `trackBackgroundEvents` setting when configuring RUM:\n\n```swift\nimport FlashcatRUM\n\nRUM.enable(\n    with: RUM.Configuration(\n        applicationID: \"<RUM_APPLICATION_ID>\",\n        trackBackgroundEvents: true\n    )\n)\n```\n\n```objective-c\n@import FlashcatObjc;\n\nDDRUMConfiguration *configuration = [[DDRUMConfiguration alloc] initWithApplicationID:@\"<RUM_APPLICATION_ID>\"];\nconfiguration.trackBackgroundEvents = YES;\n\n[RUM enableWith:configuration];\n```\n\n## Initialization Parameters\n\nWhen creating Flashcat configuration, the following properties can be set:\n\n### Flashcat Configuration\n\n| Parameter         | Type            | Required | Description

update frequency, options: `.frequent`, `.average`, `.rare`, `.never` |\n\n### Automatically Track Views\n\nTo enable automatic view tracking, set `uiKitViewsPredicate` or `swiftUIViewsPredicate` when initializing RUM.\n\nFor **UIKit**, use the `DefaultUIKitRUMViewsPredicate` class:\n\n```swift\nimport FlashcatRUM\n\nRUM.enable(\n    with: RUM.Configuration(\n        applicationID: \"<RUM_APPLICATION_ID>\",\n        uiKitViewsPredicate: DefaultUIKitRUMViewsPredicate()\n    )\n)\n```\n\nFor **SwiftUI**, use the `DefaultSwiftUIRUMViewsPredicate` class:\n\n```swift\nimport FlashcatRUM\n\nRUM.enable(\n    with: RUM.Configuration(\n        applicationID: \"<RUM_APPLICATION_ID>\",\n        swiftUIViewsPredicate: DefaultSwiftUIRUMViewsPredicate()\n    )\n)\n```\n\nYou can also implement a custom `predicate` to customize tracking behavior.\n\n### Automatically Track User Actions\n\nTo enable automatic user action tracking, set `uiKitActionsPredicate` or `swiftUIActionsPredicate` when initializing RUM.\n\nFor **UIKit**:\n\n```swift\nimport FlashcatRUM\n\nRUM.enable(\n    with: RUM.Configuration(\n        applicationID: \"<RUM_APPLICATION_ID>\",\n        uiKitActionsPredicate: DefaultUIKitRUMActionsPredicate()\n    )\n)\n```\n\nFor **SwiftUI**:\n\n```swift\nimport FlashcatRUM\n\nRUM.enable(\n    with: RUM.Configuration(\n        applicationID: \"<RUM_APPLICATION_ID>\",\n        swiftUIActionsPredicate: DefaultSwiftUIRUMActionsPredicate(isLegacyDetectionEnabled: true)\n    )\n)\n```\n\n### Automatically Track Network Requests\n\nTo enable automatic network request tracking (resources and errors), set `urlSessionTracking` when initializing RUM and enable `URLSessionInstrumentation`:\n\n```swift\nimport FlashcatRUM\n\nRUM.enable(\n    with: RUM.Configuration(\n        applicationID: \"<RUM_APPLICATION_ID>\",\n        urlSessionTracking: RUM.Configuration.URLSessionTracking()\n    )\n)\n\nURLSessionInstrumentation.enable(\n    with: .init(\n        delegateClass: SessionDelegate.self\n    )\n)\n```\n\nYou can also configure `firstPartyHostsTracing` to enable distributed tracing, associating RUM resources with backend traces:\n\n```swift\nimport FlashcatRUM\n\nRUM.enable(\n    with: RUM.Configuration(\n        applicationID: \"<RUM_APPLICATION_ID>\",\n        urlSessionTracking: RUM.Configuration.URLSessionTracking(\n            firstPartyHostsTracing: .trace(hosts: [\"example.com\", \"api.example.com\"])\n        )\n    )\n)\n```\n\n### Automatically Track Errors\n\nAll \"fatal\" and \"non-fatal\" iOS errors are automatically collected with full error details and metadata for the current RUM view.\n\nFatal errors include app crashes. Non-fatal errors include:\n\n- **Swift errors**: Errors thrown by Swift `throw`\n- **Objective-C exceptions**: Objective-C exceptions\n\nYou can view error details through RUM Explorer and Error Tracking.\n\n## Modifying or Dropping RUM Events\n\nBefore RUM events are sent to Flashcat, you can modify or completely drop them through Event Mappers.\n\nEvent mappers are set when creating RUM configuration:\n\n```swift\nimport FlashcatRUM\n\nlet configuration = RUM.Configuration(\n    applicationID: \"<RUM_APPLICATION_ID>\",\n    viewEventMapper: { RUMViewEvent in\n        return RUMViewEvent\n    },\n    errorEventMapper: { RUMErrorEvent in\n        return RUMErrorEvent\n    },\n    resourceEventMapper: { RUMResourceEvent in\n        return RUMResourceEvent\n    },\n    actionEventMapper: { RUMActionEvent in\n        return RUMActionEvent\n    },\n    longTaskEventMapper: { RUMLongTaskEvent in\n        return RUMLongTaskEvent\n    }\n)\n\nRUM.enable(with: configuration)\n```\n\n```objective-c\n@import FlashcatObjc;\n\nDDRUMConfiguration *configuration = [[DDRUMConfiguration alloc] initWithApplicationID:@\"<RUM_APPLICATION_ID>\"];\n\n[configuration setViewEventMapper:^DDRUMViewEvent * _Nonnull(DDRUMViewEvent * _Nonnull RUMViewEvent) {\n    return RUMViewEvent;\n}];\n\n[configuration setErrorEventMapper:^DDRUMErrorEvent * _Nullable(DDRUMErrorEvent * _Nonnull RUMErrorEvent) {\n    return RUMErrorEvent;\n}];\n\n[configuration setResourceEventMapper:^DDRUMResourceEvent * _Nullable(DDRUMResourceEvent * _Nonnull RUMResourceEvent) {\n    return RUMResourceEvent;\n}];\n\n[configuration setActionEventMapper:^DDRUMActionEvent * _Nullable(DDRUMActionEvent * _Nonnull RUMActionEvent) {\n    return RUMActionEvent;\n}];\n\n[configuration setLongTaskEventMapper:^DDRUMLongTaskEvent * _Nullable(DDRUMLongTaskEvent * _Nonnull RUMLongTaskEvent) {\n    return RUMLongTaskEvent;\n}];\n```\n\nEach mapper is a Swift closure with signature `(T) -> T?`, where `T` is the specific RUM event type. This allows changing parts of events before they're sent.\n\nFor example, to mask sensitive information in the `url` of a RUM Resource, implement a custom `redacted(_:) -> String` function and use it in `resourceEventMapper`:\n\n```swift\nlet configuration = RUM.Configuration(\n    applicationID: \"<RUM_APPLICATION_ID>\",\n    resourceEventMapper: { RUMResourceEvent in\n        var RUMResourceEvent = RUMResourceEvent\n        RUMResourceEvent.resource.url = redacted(RUMResourceEvent.resource.url)\n        return RUMResourceEvent\n    }\n)\n```\n\n```objective-c\nDDRUMConfiguration *configuration = [[DDRUMConfiguration alloc] initWithApplicationID:@\"<RUM_APPLICATION_ID>\"];\n\n[configuration setResourceEventMapper:^DDRUMResourceEvent * _Nullable(DDRUMResourceEvent * _Nonnull RUMResourceEvent) {\n    return RUMResourceEvent;\n}];\n```\n\nReturning `nil` from error, resource, or action mappers will completely drop the event; the event will not be sent to Flashcat. The value returned from view event mappers cannot be `nil` (to drop views, customize the `UIKitRUMViewsPredicate` implementation; see [Automatic View Tracking](https://docs.flashcat.cloud/en/flashduty/rum/ios-sdk-integration#automatically-track-views)).\n\nBased on the event type, only certain specific attributes can be modified:\n\n| Event Type       | Property Key                         | Description                            |\n| ---------------- | ------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------- |\n| RUMActionEvent   | `RUMActionEvent.action.target?.name` | Action name                            |\n|                  | `RUMActionEvent.view.url`            | View URL associated with this action   |\n| RUMErrorEvent    | `RUMErrorEvent.error.message`        | Error message                          |\n|                  | `RUMErrorEvent.error.stack`          | Error stack trace                      |\n|                  | `RUMErrorEvent.error.resource?.url`  | Resource URL referenced by the error   |\n|                  | `RUMErrorEvent.view.url`             | View URL associated with this error    |\n| RUMResourceEvent | `RUMResourceEvent.resource.url`      | Resource URL                           |\n|                  | `RUMResourceEvent.view.url`          | View URL associated with this resource |\n| RUMViewEvent     | `RUMViewEvent.view.name`             | View name                              |\n|                  | `RUMViewEvent.view.url`              | View URL                               |\n|                  | `RUMViewEvent.view.referrer`         | URL linking to initial page view       |\n\n## Getting RUM Session ID\n\nRetrieving the RUM session ID is very useful for troubleshooting. For example, you can attach the session ID to support requests, emails, or error reports so that your support team can later find user sessions in Flashcat.\n\nYou can access the RUM session ID at runtime without waiting for the `sessionStarted` event:\n\n```swift\nimport FlashcatRUM\n\nRUMMonitor.shared().currentSessionID(completion: { sessionId in\n    currentSessionId = sessionId\n})\n```\n\n```objective-c\n@import FlashcatObjc;\n\n[[RUMMonitor shared] currentSessionIDWithCompletion:^(NSString * _Nullable sessionId) {\n    // use session ID\n}];\n```\n\n## Setting Tracking Consent (GDPR Compliance)\n\nTo comply with GDPR regulations, Flashcat iOS SDK requires a tracking consent value at initialization.\n\nThe `trackingConsent` setting can be one of the following values:\n\n1. `.pending`: Flashcat iOS SDK starts collecting and batching data but does not send to Flashcat. Flashcat iOS SDK waits for a new tracking consent value to decide how to handle batched data.\n2. `.granted`: Flashcat iOS SDK starts collecting data and sends to Flashcat.\n3. `.notGranted`: Flashcat iOS SDK does not collect any data. No logs, traces, or RUM events are sent to Flashcat.\n\nAfter Flashcat iOS SDK initialization, to change the tracking consent value, use the `Flashcat.set(trackingConsent:)` API call. Flashcat iOS SDK will change its behavior based on the new value.\n\nFor example, if the current tracking consent is `.pending`:\n\n- If you change the value to `.granted`, Flashcat iOS SDK will send all current and future data to Flashcat;\n- If you change the value to `.notGranted`, Flashcat iOS SDK will clear all current data and not collect future data.\n\n```swift\nimport FlashcatCore\n\nFlashcat.set(trackingConsent: .granted)\n```\n\n```objective-c\n@import FlashcatObjc;\n\n[Flashcat setWithTrackingConsent:DDTrackingConsentGranted];\n```\n\n## Adding User Attributes\n\nYou can use the `Flashcat.addUserExtraInfo(_:)` API to attach additional user attributes to previously set attributes.\n\n```swift\nimport FlashcatCore\n\nFlashcat.addUserExtraInfo([\"company\": \"Flashcat\"])\n```\n\n```objective-c\n@import FlashcatObjc;\n\n[Flashcat addUserExtraInfo:@{@\"company\": @\"Flashcat\"}];\n```\n\n## Data Management\n\n### Clear All Data\n\nYou can optionally delete all unsent data stored by the SDK using the `Flashcat.clearAllData()` API:\n\n```swift\nimport FlashcatCore\n\nFlashcat.clearAllData()\n```\n\n```objective-c\n@import FlashcatObjc;\n\n[Flashcat clearAllData];\n```\n\n### Stop Data Collection\n\nYou can use the `Flashcat.stopInstance()` API to stop a named SDK instance (or default instance if name is `nil`) from further collecting and uploading data.\n\n```swift\nimport FlashcatCore\n\nFlashcat.stopInstance()\n```\n\n```objective-c\n@import FlashcatObjc;\n\n[Flashcat stopInstance];\n```\n\nCalling this method disables the SDK and all active features like RUM. To resume data collection, you must reinitialize the SDK. If you want to dynamically change configuration, you can use this API.\n\n## Sampling\n\nBy default, Flashcat RUM collects data for all sessions. You can reduce the number of sessions collected by setting a sampling rate (percentage) through the `sessionSampleRate` parameter. For example, to collect 90% of sessions:\n\n```swift\nimport FlashcatRUM\n\nRUM.enable(\n    with: RUM.Configuration(\n        applicationID: \"<RUM_APPLICATION_ID>\",\n        sessionSampleRate: 90\n    )\n)\n```\n\n```objective-c\n@import FlashcatObjc;\n\nDDRUMConfiguration *configuration = [[DDRUMConfiguration alloc] initWithApplicationID:@\"<RUM_APPLICATION_ID>\"];\nconfiguration.sessionSampleRate = 90;\n\n[RUM enableWith:configuration];\n```\n\nSampled sessions will not collect any views and their associated telemetry data.\n\n## Integrating RUM with Distributed Tracing\n\nIntegrating RUM with distributed tracing allows you to correlate requests from your iOS application with their corresponding backend traces. This combination enables you to see complete frontend and backend data at a glance.\n\nUse frontend data from RUM along with backend, infrastructure, and log information from trace ID injection to locate issues anywhere in the stack and understand user experience.\n\n### Configuration Method\n\nInitialize the RUM SDK, using `firstPartyHostsTracing` to configure your current app's API service domains:\n\n```swift\nimport FlashcatRUM\n\nRUM.enable(\n    with: RUM.Configuration(\n        applicationID: \"<RUM_APPLICATION_ID>\",\n        urlSessionTracking: RUM.Configuration.URLSessionTracking(\n            firstPartyHostsTracing: .trace(\n                hosts: [\n                    \"api.example.com\",\n                    \"example.com\"\n                ],\n                sampleRate: 20\n            )\n        )\n    )\n)\n\nURLSessionInstrumentation.enable(\n    with: .init(\n        delegateClass: SessionDelegate.self\n    )\n)\n```\n\n```objective-c\n@import FlashcatObjc;\n\nDDRUMConfiguration *configuration = [[DDRUMConfiguration alloc] initWithApplicationID:@\"<RUM_APPLICATION_ID>\"];\n\nDDURLSessionTracking *urlSessionTracking = [DDURLSessionTracking new];\n[urlSessionTracking setFirstPartyHostsTracing:[DDRUMFirstPartyHostsTracing alloc] initWithHosts:@[@\"api.example.com\", @\"example.com\"] sampleRate:20];\n\nconfiguration.urlSessionTracking = urlSessionTracking;\n\n[RUM enableWith:configuration];\n\n[DDURLSessionInstrumentation enableWithConfiguration:[DDURLSessionInstrumentationConfiguration alloc] initWithDelegateClass:[SessionDelegate class]]];\n```\n\n**Parameter descriptions:**\n\n- `hosts`: List of domains to trace\n- `sampleRate`: Percentage of requests to trace (0-100), default 100\n\n### How Correlation Works\n\nThe distributed tracing protocol is implemented by adding corresponding header fields (`traceparent`, `tracestate`) to HTTP headers. Here's an explanation of the corresponding headers:\n\n```\ntraceparent: [version]-[trace id]-[parent id]-[trace flags]\n```\n\n- `version`: Currently `00`\n- `trace id`: 128-bit trace ID converted to 32 characters after hex processing\n- `parent id`: 64-bit span ID, 16 characters after hex processing\n- `trace flags`: Indicates whether sampled, `01` means sampled, `00` means not sampled\n\n```\ntracestate: dd=s:[sampling priority];o:[origin]\n```\n\n- `sampling priority`: `1` means trace is sampled\n- `origin`: Always `rum`, indicating collection through RUM SDK\n\n**Example:**\n\n```\ntraceparent: 00-00000000000000008448eb211c80319c-b7ad6b7169203331-01\ntracestate: dd=s:1;o:rum\n```\n\n### How to Verify\n\nAfter adding configuration, you can view requests sent from the app in Xcode's network debugging tools or proxy tools (such as Charles, Proxyman). If they correctly carry the corresponding headers, the configuration is correct.\n\n## Notes\n\n- Ensure `applicationID` and `clientToken` are configured correctly to avoid data upload failures\n- Adjust sampling rate and privacy settings according to app requirements, balancing data volume and compliance\n- Attributes modified in event mappers should follow the allowed modification attributes list\n- For complex view tracking scenarios, implementing custom `ViewsPredicate` is recommended\n\n## Further Reading\n\n- [iOS SDK Integration Guide](https://docs.flashcat.cloud/en/flashduty/rum/ios-sdk-integration): Learn how to integrate the iOS SDK\n- [RUM Data Collection](https://docs.flashcat.cloud/en/flashduty/rum/data-collection): Learn about RUM data types\n- [RUM Analysis Dashboard](https://docs.flashcat.cloud/en/flashduty/rum/analysis-dashboard): View and analyze RUM data\n- [Tracking iOS Errors](https://docs.flashcat.cloud/en/flashduty/rum/ios-error-tracking): Learn how to track and debug iOS errors\n",

Each RUM event includes default attributes, such as the page URL corresponding to the event (`view.url`) and user information like device type (`device.type`) and country (`geo.country`).\n\nAdditionally, different event types have specific additional metrics and attributes. For example, the `view.loading_time` metric is associated with view events, while the `resource.method` attribute is associated with resource events.\n\n## Default Attributes\n\nFlashcat Web RUM SDK automatically captures the following default attributes, which apply to all RUM event types.\n\n### Common Core Attributes\n\n| Attribute        | Type    | Description                                                            |\n| ---------------- | ------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| `date`           | Integer | Event timestamp (in milliseconds, epoch milliseconds).                 |\n| `type`           | String  | Event type (such as `session`, `view`, `resource`, `error`, `action`). |\n| `application.id` | String  | Unique application identifier.                                         |\n| `service`        | String  | Service name that generated this event.                                |\n| `env`            | String  | Application environment name (such as `prod`, `dev`, `staging`).       |\n| `version`        | String  | Application version.                                                   |\n| `sdk_version`    | String  | Flashcat RUM SDK version.                                              |\n\n### Device\n\nThe following device-related attributes are automatically attached to all events collected by Flashcat:\n\n| Attribute      | Type   | Description                                                         |\n| -------------- | ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| `device.type`  | String | Device type (such as `Desktop`, `Mobile`, `Tablet`, `TV`, `Other`). |\n| `device.brand` | String | Device brand (such as `Apple`, `Samsung`, `Huawei`).                |\n| `device.model` | String | Device model (such as `iPhone`, `iPad`).                            |\n| `device.name`  | String | Device commercial name.                                             |\n\n### Operating System\n\nThe following OS-related attributes are automatically attached to all events collected by Flashcat:\n\n| Attribute          | Type   | Description                                                 |\n| ------------------ | ------ | ----------------------------------------------------------- |\n| `os.name`          | String | Operating system name (such as `Mac OS`, `Windows`, `iOS`). |\n| `os.version`       | String | OS version number (such as `10.15.7`, `11.0`).              |\n| `os.version_major` | String | OS major version number (such as `10`, `11`).               |\n\n### Browser\n\nThe following browser-related attributes are automatically attached to all Web RUM events:\n\n| Attribute                 | Type   | Description                                                   |\n| ------------------------- | ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| `browser.name`            | String | Browser name (such as `Chrome`, `Firefox`, `Safari`, `Edge`). |\n| `browser.version`         | String | Browser version number (such as `91.0.4472.124`).             |\n| `browser.version_major`   | String | Browser major version number (such as `91`).                  |\n| `browser.user_agent`      | String | User Agent string.                                            |\n| `browser.viewport.width`  | Number | Browser viewport width (pixels).                              |\n| `browser.viewport.height` | Number | Browser viewport height (pixels).                             |\n\n### Geolocation\n\nThe following attributes relate to the geographic location of the IP address:\n\n| Attribute                 | Type   | Description                                                                                |\n| ------------------------- | ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |\n| `geo.country`             | String | Country name.                                                                              |\n| `geo.country_iso_code`    | String | Country ISO code (such as `US`, `CN`).                                                     |\n| `geo.country_subdivision` | String | First-level administrative division of the country (such as US states, Chinese provinces). |\n| `geo.continent_code`      | String | Continent ISO code (such as `EU`, `AS`, `NA`).                                             |\n| `geo.continent`           | String | Continent name.                                                                            |\n| `geo.city`                | String | City name.                                                                                 |\n\n**Note**: Geolocation information is inferred by the Flashcat backend from the client IP address and does not collect precise GPS location on the client.\n\n### Global User Attributes\n\nYou can enable user tracking on all RUM events to correlate user sessions and simplify troubleshooting. User attributes are optional, but it's recommended to provide the following:\n\n| Attribute   | Type   | Description                                                        |\n| ----------- | ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |\n| `usr.id`    | String | Unique user identifier.                                            |\n| `usr.name`  | String | User-friendly name, displayed by default in RUM UI.                |\n| `usr.email` | String | User email address. Email is displayed if no username is provided. |\n\nYou can also add custom user attributes, such as `usr.plan`, `usr.role`, etc.\n\nTo set user information, see [Tracking User Information](./1.%20SDK%20Integration.md#tracking-user-information).\n\n## Event-Specific Attributes\n\nDifferent event types have specific attributes and metrics.\n\n### Session Attributes\n\n| Attribute                   | Type    | Description                                        |\n| --------------------------- | ------- | -------------------------------------------------- |\n|

The SDK follows these rules:\n\n- When network is available, data is sent in batches.\n- If network is unavailable or data upload fails, batches are retained until successfully sent.\n- Data exceeding a certain time limit is automatically cleaned up to avoid occupying excessive storage space.\n\nThis means data won't be lost even if users use your app while offline.\n\n**Note**: Sensitive data should not be included in RUM events, or should be obfuscated or filtered before sending through the `beforeSend` callback.\n\n## Data Upload\n\nFlashcat Web RUM SDK uploads collected events in batches to the server to optimize network performance and reduce impact on user experience.\n\n### Batching Mechanism\n\n1. **Event Collection**: SDK adds events to in-memory batch buffer.\n2. **Batch Upload**: Batches are uploaded when one of the following conditions is met:\n   - Number of events in batch reaches threshold\n   - Batch size reaches threshold\n   - Periodic upload (e.g., every 10 seconds)\n   - Page unload (`beforeunload` event)\n\n### Upload Strategy\n\n- **Beacon API**: Prioritizes using [Beacon API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Beacon_API) to send data, ensuring data isn't lost during page unload.\n- **XHR/Fetch Fallback**: If Beacon API is unavailable, uses XMLHttpRequest or Fetch API.\n- **Retry on Failure**: If upload fails, batches are retained in local storage until successfully sent.\n\n### Data Compression\n\nBefore upload, Flashcat SDK compresses batch data to reduce network traffic and upload time.\n\n## Privacy and Compliance\n\nFlashcat Web RUM SDK is designed with privacy and data protection in mind:\n\n- **IP Address Anonymization**: SDK can be configured to anonymize IP addresses.\n- **Sensitive Data Filtering**: Use `beforeSend` callback to filter or obfuscate sensitive information.\n- **Cookie and Storage Control**: Can configure whether to use cookies and local storage.\n- **GDPR/CCPA Compliance**: Supports user privacy opt-out mechanism.\n\nFor more information on privacy configuration, see [Advanced Configuration](./2.%20Advanced%20Configuration.md).\n\n## More Information\n\n- [Web SDK Integration](./1.%20SDK%20Integration.md): Learn how to integrate Flashcat RUM SDK in Web apps\n- [Web SDK Advanced Configuration](./2.%20Advanced%20Configuration.md): Learn how to configure advanced SDK features\n- [RUM Data Collection](../../8.%20Others/2.%20Data%20Collection.md): Learn about RUM general data collection mechanism\n",

The RUM SDK is bundled with the rest of your frontend JavaScript code. It has no impact on page load performance. However, the SDK might miss errors, resources, and user actions triggered before the SDK initialization.\n\n**CDN async**\n\nThis method is recommended for web applications with performance goals. The RUM browser SDK is loaded asynchronously from our CDN, ensuring the SDK download doesn't impact page load performance. However, the SDK might miss errors, resources, and user actions triggered before the SDK initialization.\n\n**CDN sync**\n\nThis method is recommended to collect all RUM events. The RUM browser SDK is loaded synchronously from our CDN, ensuring the SDK loads first and collects all errors, resources, and user actions. This method might impact page load performance.\n\n### NPM Package Integration\n\nAdd `@flashcatcloud/browser-rum` to your `package.json` file\n\n```bash\nnpm install @flashcatcloud/browser-rum\n```\n\nThen initialize in your application entry file:\n\n```javascript\nimport { flashcatRum } from \"@flashcatcloud/browser-rum\";\n\nflashcatRum.init({\n  applicationId: \"<YOUR_APPLICATION_ID>\", // Get from application management page\n  clientToken: \"<YOUR_CLIENT_TOKEN>\", // Get from application management page\n  service: \"<SERVICE_NAME>\", // Service name to distinguish different services\n  env: \"<ENV_NAME>\", // Environment identifier\n  version: \"1.0.0\", // Application version\n  sessionSampleRate: 100, // Sampling rate\n});\n```\n\n### CDN Asynchronous Integration\n\nAdd the following code snippet to the `head` tag of each `HTML` page you want to monitor.\n\n```html\n<script>\n  (function (h, o, u, n, d) {\n    h = h[d] = h[d] || {\n      q: [],\n      onReady: function (c) {\n        h.q.push(c);\n      },\n    };\n    d = o.createElement(u);\n    d.async = 1;\n    d.src = n;\n    n = o.getElementsByTagName(u)[0];\n    n.parentNode.insertBefore(d, n);\n  })(\n    window,\n    document,\n    \"script\",\n    \"https://static.flashcat.cloud/browser-sdk/v0/flashcat-rum.js\",\n    \"FC_RUM\"\n  );\n  window.FC_RUM.onReady(function () {\n    window.FC_RUM.init({\n      applicationId: \"<YOUR_APPLICATION_ID>\", // Get from application management page\n      clientToken: \"<YOUR_CLIENT_TOKEN>\", // Get from application management page\n      service: \"<SERVICE_NAME>\", // Service name to distinguish different services\n      env: \"<ENV_NAME>\", // Environment identifier\n      version: \"1.0.0\", // Application version\n      sessionSampleRate: 100, // Sampling rate\n    });\n  });\n</script>\n```\n\n### CDN Synchronous Integration\n\nAdd the following code snippet to the beginning of the `head` tag in each `HTML` page you want to monitor (before any other `script` tags).\n\n```html\n<script\n  src=\"https://static.flashcat.cloud/browser-sdk/v0/flashcat-rum.js\"\n  type=\"text/javascript\"\n></script>\n<script>\n  window.FC_RUM &&\n    window.FC_RUM.init({\n      applicationId: \"<YOUR_APPLICATION_ID>\", // Get from application management page\n      clientToken: \"<YOUR_CLIENT_TOKEN>\", // Get from application management page\n      service: \"<SERVICE_NAME>\", // Service name to distinguish different services\n      env: \"<ENV_NAME>\", // Environment identifier\n      version: \"1.0.0\", // Application version\n      sessionSampleRate: 100, // Sampling rate\n    });\n</script>\n```\n\nYou can check for loading issues with `window.FC_RUM` if the RUM browser SDK fails to load.\n\n## Initialization Parameters\n\n| Configuration                       | Type                       | Required | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                          |\n| ----------------------------------- | -------------------------- | -------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| applicationId                       | String                     | Yes      | Application ID, obtained from the application management page                                                                                                                                                        |\n| clientToken                         | String                     | Yes      | Client Token, obtained from the application management page                                                                                                                                                          |\n| service                             | String                     | Yes      | Service name, used to distinguish different services                                                                                                                                                                 |\n| env                                 | String                     | No       | Environment identifier, such as production, staging, etc.                                                                                                                                                            |\n| version                             | String                     | No       | Application version                                                                                                                                                                                                  |\n| trackingConsent                     | \"granted\" \\| \"not-granted\" | No       | Set initial user tracking consent status.

Default: `false`                                                            |\n\n## Use Cases\n\n### Custom User Identification\n\nUse `flashcatRum.setUser(<USER_CONFIG_OBJECT>)` to add identifying attributes (such as ID, name, email) for the current user\n\n```javascript\nflashcatRum.setUser({\n  id: '1234',\n  name: 'John Doe',\n  email: 'john@doe.com',\n  plan: 'premium',\n  ...\n})\n```\n\n### Adding Custom Tags\n\nAfter initializing RUM, use the `setGlobalContextProperty` API to add additional tags to all RUM events collected from your application\n\n```javascript\nimport { flashcatRum } from \"@flashcatcloud/browser-rum\";\n\nflashcatRum.setGlobalContextProperty('<CONTEXT_KEY>', <CONTEXT_VALUE>);\n\n// Code example\nflashcatRum.setGlobalContextProperty('activity', {\n  hasPaid: true,\n  amount: 23.42\n});\n```\n\n### Sending Custom Actions\n\nUse the `addAction` API to create RUM actions. Name your action and attach context properties in the form of a JavaScript object.\n\nThe following example creates a checkout action with details about the user's cart when they click the checkout button.\n\n```javascript\nimport { flashcatRum } from \"@flashcatcloud/browser-rum\";\n\nfunction onCheckoutButtonClick(cart) {\n  flashcatRum.addAction(\"checkout\", {\n    value: cart.value, // for example, 42.12\n    items: cart.items, // for example, ['tomato', 'strawberries']\n  });\n}\n```\n\n### Custom Error Addition\n\nYou can attach a dd_context property directly to error instances, and the RUM SDK will automatically detect this property and merge it into the final error event context.\n\n```javascript\nconst error = new Error(\"Something went wrong\");\nerror.dd_context = { component: \"Menu\", param: 123 };\nthrow error;\n```\n\n## Validation\n\nAfter integration, you can validate whether the integration was successful through the following steps:\n\n1. Open browser developer tools and check if there are data reporting requests to `https://browser.flashcat.cloud/api/v2/rum` in the Network panel\n2. Visit the Flashduty console to check if RUM application data is displayed normally\n3. Trigger some user interactions to verify if data collection is working properly\n\n## Further Reading\n\n- [RUM Application Management](https://docs.flashcat.cloud/en/flashduty/rum/application-management?nav=01JCQ7A4N4WRWNXW8EWEHXCMF5): Learn how to create and manage RUM applications\n- [RUM SDK Advanced Configuration](https://docs.flashcat.cloud/en/flashduty/rum/advanced-configuration?nav=01JCQ7A4N4WRWNXW8EWEHXCMF5): Learn how to configure advanced features of the SDK\n- [RUM Analysis Dashboard](https://docs.flashcat.cloud/en/flashduty/rum/analysis-dashboard?nav=01JCQ7A4N4WRWNXW8EWEHXCMF5): View and analyze RUM data\n",

This guide ensures the normal operation of RUM monitoring.\n\n## Data Collection Verification\n\n---\n\nIf you don't see data in the RUM platform, check the following steps:\n\n### SDK Installation Check\n\n1. **Verify script inclusion**: Confirm that the RUM SDK is correctly included:\n\n   ```html\n   <!-- CDN import method -->\n   <script\n     src=\"https://static.flashcat.cloud/browser-sdk/v0/flashcat-rum.js\"\n     type=\"text/javascript\"\n   ></script>\n   <script>\n     window.FC_RUM &&\n       window.FC_RUM.init({\n         applicationId: \"YOUR_APPLICATION_ID\",\n         clientToken: \"YOUR_CLIENT_TOKEN\",\n         service: \"<SERVICE_NAME>\",\n         env: \"<ENV_NAME>\",\n         version: \"1.0.0\",\n         sessionSampleRate: 100,\n       });\n   </script>\n   ```\n\n   Or npm initialization method:\n\n   ```javascript\n   import { flashcatRum } from \"@flashcatcloud/browser-rum\";\n\n   flashcatRum.init({\n     applicationId: \"YOUR_APPLICATION_ID\",\n     clientToken: \"YOUR_CLIENT_TOKEN\",\n     // Other configurations\n   });\n   ```\n\n2. **Check console**: Open browser developer tools and check for JavaScript errors.\n\n3. **Verify configuration**: Confirm that the application ID and client token are correct.\n\n### Network Request Check\n\n1. Open the browser developer tools network panel\n2. Filter for `browser.flashcat.cloud` requests\n3. Confirm requests are sent successfully (status code 200)\n4. If requests fail, check specific error messages\n\n### Browser Compatibility\n\nConfirm your browser version is supported:\n\n- Chrome 60 and above\n- Firefox 60 and above\n- Safari 12 and above\n- Edge 15 and above\n- Internet Explorer 11 (some features limited)\n\n### Ad Blocker Impact\n\nSome ad blocker plugins may affect RUM SDK operation. Recommendations:\n\n- Temporarily disable ad blockers for testing\n- Whitelist your domain and `browser.flashcat.cloud`\n\n## Common Issue Resolution\n\n---\n\n### No Data Displayed\n\n**Issue**: SDK configuration is complete, but no data appears on the platform.\n\n**Solution**:\n\n1. **Wait for data synchronization**: Data typically appears within 5 minutes\n\n2. **Check initialization**: Ensure the SDK is initialized when the page loads\n\n3. **Check sampling rate**: Confirm the sampling rate is set appropriately:\n\n   ```javascript\n   flashcatRum.init({\n     // ... other configurations\n     sampleRate: 100, // Set to 100 to collect all data\n   });\n   ```\n\n4. **Check user authorization**: Confirm user tracking consent status:\n\n   ```javascript\n   flashcatRum.setTrackingConsent(\"granted\");\n   ```\n\n### Missing Behavior Data\n\n**Issue**: User behavior data is incomplete.\n\n**Solution**:\n\n1. **Enable behavior tracking**: Confirm behavior tracking configuration:\n\n   ```javascript\n   flashcatRum.init({\n     // ... other configurations\n     trackUserInteractions: true,\n   });\n   ```\n\n2. **Check element marking**: Add behavior markers for custom elements:\n\n   ```html\n   <button data-action-name=\"Submit Form\">Submit</button>\n   ```\n\n3. **Manual behavior recording**: For complex interactions, use manual recording:\n\n   ```javascript\n   flashcatRum.addAction(\"click\", \"Custom Button Click\");\n   ```\n\n### Missing Error Data\n\n**Issue**: JavaScript exceptions are not recorded.\n\n**Solution**:\n\n1. **Enable error tracking**: Confirm error tracking configuration:\n\n   ```javascript\n   flashcatRum.init({\n     // ... other configurations\n     trackErrors: true,\n   });\n   ```\n\n2. **Error handling optimization**: Ensure exceptions can be captured by the SDK:\n\n   ```javascript\n   try {\n     // Code that might cause an error\n   } catch (error) {\n     console.error(error);\n     flashcatRum.addError(error);\n   }\n   ```\n\n3. **Configure source maps**: Helps locate issues in production environments\n\n### Performance Issues\n\n**Issue**: Concerns about RUM SDK affecting website performance.\n\n**Solution**:\n\n1. **Optimize configuration**: Only enable necessary features:\n\n   ```javascript\n   flashcatRum.init({\n     // ... other configurations\n     trackResources: true,\n     trackLongTasks: false, // Disable unnecessary features\n     trackErrors: true,\n     trackUserInteractions: true,\n   });\n   ```\n\n2. **Adjust sampling rate**: Adjust sampling based on traffic:\n\n   ```javascript\n   flashcatRum.init({\n     // ... other configurations\n     sampleRate: 50, // Only collect 50% of data\n   });\n   ```\n\n3. **Resource filtering**: Only track important resources:\n\n   ```javascript\n   flashcatRum.init({\n     // ... other configurations\n     resourceUrlFilter: function (url) {\n       // Only track API and critical resources\n       return url.includes(\"/api/\") || url.includes(\"/critical/\");\n     },\n   });\n   ```\n\n### CSP Configuration Issues\n\n**Issue**: CSP policy blocks RUM SDK execution.\n\n**Solution**:\n\n1. **Update script policy**: Allow SDK loading:\n\n   ```\n   script-src 'self' https://cdn.flashcat.cloud;\n   ```\n\n2. **Update connection policy**: Allow data reporting:\n\n   ```\n   connect-src 'self' https://browser.flashcat.cloud;\n   ```\n\n### Single Page Application Issues\n\n**Issue**: Page visits in single page applications are not recorded.\n\n**Solution**:\n\n1. **Manually record page visits**:\n\n   ```javascript\n   // When route changes\n   flashcatRum.startView({\n     name: \"Product Page\",\n     url: \"/products/123\",\n   });\n   ```\n\n2. **Framework integration**:\n\n   React Router integration:\n\n   ```javascript\n   import { useEffect } from \"react\";\n   import { useLocation } from \"react-router-dom\";\n\n   function RumRouteTracker() {\n     const location = useLocation();\n\n     useEffect(() => {\n       flashcatRum.startView({\n         name: location.pathname,\n         url: location.pathname + location.search,\n       });\n     }, [location]);\n\n     return null;\n   }\n   ```\n\n   Vue Router integration:\n\n   ```javascript\n   router.afterEach((to) => {\n     flashcatRum.startView({\n       name: to.name || to.path,\n       url: to.path + to.fullPath.substring(to.path.length),\n     });\n   });\n   ```\n\n## Advanced Debugging\n\n---\n\n### Debug Mode\n\nEnable debug mode for detailed logs:\n\n```javascript\nflashcatRum.init({\n  // ... other configurations\n  debug: true,\n});\n```\n\n### Data Collection Testing\n\nForce enable data collection for testing:\n\n```javascript\nflashcatRum.init({\n  // ... other configurations\n  sampleRate: 100,\n  forceTracking: true,\n});\n```\n\n### Network Analysis\n\nCheck data reporting requests:\n\n1. Open developer tools\n2. Switch to the network panel\n3. Filter for `browser.flashcat.cloud` requests\n4. View request data\n\n### Debug Commands\n\nDebug commands available in the browser console:\n\n```javascript\n// Get RUM context\nwindow.FC_RUM.getInternalContext();\n\n// Get current session ID\nwindow.FC_RUM.getCurrentSessionId();\n\n// Get current page ID\nwindow.FC_RUM.getCurrentViewId();\n```\n\n## Contact Technical Support\n\n---\n\nIf you still have issues after following the above steps, please contact us:\n\n1.

View names are calculated from the current page URL by default and automatically remove variable IDs (path segments containing numbers). For example, `/dashboard/1234` and `/dashboard/9a` are normalized to `/dashboard/?`.\n\nYou can manually track view events by setting the `trackViewsManually` option and specify custom names for views along with their associated services and versions.\n\n### Configure Manual View Tracking\n\nWhen initializing the Flashduty RUM SDK, set `trackViewsManually` to `true`:\n\n```javascript\nimport { flashcatRum } from \"@flashcatcloud/browser-rum\";\n\nflashcatRum.init({\n  applicationId: \"<YOUR_APPLICATION_ID>\",\n  clientToken: \"<YOUR_CLIENT_TOKEN>\",\n  site: \"flashduty.com\",\n  trackViewsManually: true,\n});\n```\n\nAfter enabling manual tracking, you need to call the `startView` method on each new page or route change (for single-page applications) to start a view. RUM data will begin collecting when the view starts. You can add context to the view and its child events.\n\n#### Parameter Description\n\n- **name** (string): View name, defaults to the page URL path.\n- **service** (string): Service name, defaults to the service specified when creating the RUM application.\n- **version** (string): Application version, defaults to the version specified when creating the RUM application.\n- **context** (object): Additional context for the view, applied to the view and its child events.\n\n### Example: Manually Track Checkout Page View\n\nThe following example manually tracks a checkout page view in a RUM application, using `checkout` as the view name and associating it with the `purchase` service, version `1.2.3`:\n\n```javascript\nflashcatRum.startView({\n  name: \"checkout\",\n  service: \"purchase\",\n  version: \"1.2.3\",\n  context: {\n    payment: \"Done\",\n  },\n});\n```\n\n### React Router Integration\n\nFor applications using React Router v6, you can override default view names to match route names defined in your React application through the following steps:\n\n1. Set `trackViewsManually` to `true` during initialization (as shown above).\n2. Start views on route changes using the `useLocation` and `matchRoutes` APIs from `react-router-dom`.\n\nHere's an example:\n\n```javascript\nimport { matchRoutes, useLocation } from \"react-router-dom\";\nimport { routes } from \"path/to/routes\";\nimport { flashcatRum } from \"@flashcatcloud/browser-rum\";\nimport { useEffect } from \"react\";\n\nexport default function App() {\n  let location = useLocation();\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n    const routeMatches = matchRoutes(routes, location.pathname);\n    const viewName = routeMatches && computeViewName(routeMatches);\n    if (viewName) {\n      flashcatRum.startView({ name: viewName });\n    }\n  }, [location.pathname]);\n\n  // ...\n}\n\n// Compute view name\nfunction computeViewName(routeMatches) {\n  let viewName = \"\";\n  for (let index = 0; index < routeMatches.length; index++) {\n    const routeMatch = routeMatches[index];\n    const path = routeMatch.route.path;\n    if (!path) continue; // Skip routes without paths\n\n    if (path.startsWith(\"/\")) {\n      viewName = path; // Handle absolute sub-route paths\n    } else {\n      viewName += viewName.endsWith(\"/\") ? path : `/${path}`; // Handle path concatenation\n    }\n  }\n\n  return viewName || \"/\";\n}\n```\n\n### Set View Name\n\nUse the `setViewName` method to update the current view's name without starting a new view. The changed view name affects the view and its child events (from the moment of the call onwards).\n\n```javascript\nflashcatRum.setViewName(\"Checkout\");\n```\n\n## Enrich and Control RUM Data\n\nThe Flashduty RUM browser SDK automatically captures RUM events and populates their main attributes. Through the `beforeSend` callback function, you can intercept and modify events before they are sent to Flashduty, supporting the following operations:\n\n- **Enrich events**: Add additional context attributes.\n- **Modify events**: Change event content or mask sensitive information.\n- **Discard events**: Selectively discard specific RUM events.\n\nThe `beforeSend` callback accepts two parameters:\n\n- **event**: The event generated by the RUM browser SDK.\n- **context**: The context that triggered the event creation.\n\n### Context Types\n\nDifferent event types correspond to different contexts:\n\n- **View**: `Location` object.\n- **Action**: The triggering `Event` and handling stack.\n- **Resource (XHR)**: `XMLHttpRequest`, `PerformanceResourceTiming`, and handling stack.\n- **Resource (Fetch)**: `Request`, `Response`, `PerformanceResourceTiming`, and handling stack.\n- **Resource (Other)**: `PerformanceResourceTiming`.\n- **Error**: `Error` object.\n- **Long Task**: `PerformanceLongTaskTiming`.\n\n### Enrich RUM Events\n\nYou can add context attributes to events through the `beforeSend` callback. For example, adding data from response headers to resource events:\n\n```javascript\nflashcatRum.init({\n  applicationId: \"<YOUR_APPLICATION_ID>\",\n  clientToken: \"<YOUR_CLIENT_TOKEN>\",\n  site: \"flashduty.com\",\n  beforeSend: (event, context) => {\n    if (event.type === \"resource\" && event.resource.type === \"fetch\") {\n      event.context.responseHeaders = Object.fromEntries(\n        context.response.headers\n      );\n    }\n    return true;\n  },\n});\n```\n\nYou can also add attributes to events through the global context API. Note: Only attributes in `event.context` will be recognized by the RUM SDK.\n\n### Modify RUM Event Content\n\nYou can modify event content through `beforeSend`, for example, masking email addresses from view URLs:\n\n```javascript\nflashcatRum.init({\n  applicationId: \"<YOUR_APPLICATION_ID>\",\n  clientToken: \"<YOUR_CLIENT_TOKEN>\",\n  site: \"flashduty.com\",\n  beforeSend: (event) => {\n    event.view.url = event.view.url.replace(/email=[^&]*/, \"email=REDACTED\");\n  },\n});\n```\n\n#### Modifiable Attributes\n\nThe following attributes can be modified through `beforeSend`:\n\n- **view.url** (string): Current page URL.\n- **view.referrer** (string): Previous page URL.\n- **view.name** (string): Current view name.\n- **view.performance.lcp.resource_url** (string): Resource URL for Largest Contentful Paint (LCP).\n- **service** (string): Application service name.\n- **version** (string): Application version.\n- **action.target.name** (string): Element involved in user interaction (for automatically collected actions only).\n- **error.message** (string): Error message.\n- **error.stack** (string): Error stack or supplementary information.\n- **error.resource.url** (string): Resource URL that triggered the error.\n- **resource.url** (string): Resource URL.\n- **long_task.scripts.source_url** (string): Script resource URL for long tasks.\n- **long_task.scripts.invoker** (string): Name of the invoking script.\n- **context** (object): Attributes added through global context API, view context API, or manually generated events (such as `addError`, `addAction`).\n\nModifications to other attributes will be ignored.\n\n### Discard RUM Events\n\nBy returning `false` in `beforeSend`, you can discard specific RUM events (except view events):\n\n```javascript\nflashcatRum.init({\n  applicationId: \"<YOUR_APPLICATION_ID>\",\n  clientToken: \"<YOUR_CLIENT_TOKEN>\",\n  site: \"flashduty.com\",\n  beforeSend: (event) => {\n    if (shouldDiscard(event)) {\n      return false;\n    }\n  },\n});\n```\n\n## User Sessions\n\nBy adding user information to RUM sessions, you can:\n\n- Track browsing paths of specific users.\n- Understand which users are most affected by errors.\n- Monitor performance for key users.\n\n### User Attributes\n\nThe following are optional user attributes, with at least one recommended:\n\n- **usr.id** (string): Unique user identifier.\n- **usr.name** (string): User-friendly name, displayed by default in the RUM UI.\n- **usr.email** (string): User email, displayed if no name is provided.\n\nYou can also add additional attributes, such as user plan or user group information, to enhance filtering capabilities.\n\n### User Session API\n\n#### Set User Session\n\n```javascript\nflashcatRum.setUser({\n  id: \"1234\",\n  name: \"John Doe\",\n  email: \"john@doe.com\",\n  plan: \"premium\",\n});\n```\n\n#### Get User Session\n\n```javascript\nconst user = flashcatRum.getUser();\n```\n\n#### Add/Override User Attributes\n\n```javascript\nflashcatRum.setUserProperty(\"name\", \"John Doe\");\n```\n\n#### Remove User Attributes\n\n```javascript\nflashcatRum.removeUserProperty(\"name\");\n```\n\n#### Clear User Session\n\n```javascript\nflashcatRum.clearUser();\n```\n\n**Note**:\n\n- After user session information changes, subsequent RUM events will include the updated information.\n- After logout (calling `clearUser`), the last view will still retain user information, but subsequent views and session-level data will not.\n\n## Sampling\n\nBy default, Flashduty RUM collects data for all sessions. You can use the `sessionSampleRate` parameter to set a sampling rate (percentage) to reduce the number of sessions collected. For example, to collect 90% of sessions:\n\n```javascript\nflashcatRum.init({\n  applicationId: \"<YOUR_APPLICATION_ID>\",\n  clientToken: \"<YOUR_CLIENT_TOKEN>\",\n  site: \"flashduty.com\",\n  sessionSampleRate: 90,\n});\n```\n\nSampled sessions will not collect any page views and their related telemetry data.\n\n## User Tracking Consent\n\nTo comply with privacy regulations such as GDPR and CCPA, Flashduty RUM allows setting user tracking consent status (`trackingConsent`) during initialization. Available values:\n\n- **\"granted\"**: Begin collecting data and sending it to Flashduty.\n- **\"not-granted\"**: Do not collect any data.\n\nYou can change the consent status after initialization using the `setTrackingConsent` API:\n\n- Changing from `\"granted\"` to `\"not-granted\"`: Stops the RUM session, and data is no longer sent.\n- Changing from `\"not-granted\"` to `\"granted\"`: If there is no active session, a new session will be created and data collection resumes.\n\n**Note**: Consent status is not synchronized between tabs or persisted; you need to provide the user's decision during initialization or through `setTrackingConsent`.\n\n### Example: Handling User Consent\n\n```javascript\nflashcatRum.init({\n  applicationId: \"<YOUR_APPLICATION_ID>\",\n  clientToken: \"<YOUR_CLIENT_TOKEN>\",\n  site: \"flashduty.com\",\n  trackingConsent: \"not-granted\",\n});\n\nacceptCookieBannerButton.addEventListener(\"click\", function () {\n  flashcatRum.setTrackingConsent(\"granted\");\n});\n```\n\n## View Context\n\nView event context can be modified. You can add or modify context for the current view and its child events (such as actions, errors, timings) through the following APIs:\n\n- `startView`: Specify context when starting a view.\n- `setViewContextProperty`: Add or modify a context property for the current view.\n- `setViewContext`: Replace the context for the current view.\n\n### Example: Add View Context\n\n```javascript\nflashcatRum.setViewContextProperty(\"activity\", {\n  hasPaid: true,\n  amount: 23.42,\n});\n```\n\n### Example: Replace View Context\n\n```javascript\nflashcatRum.setViewContext({\n  originalUrl: \"shopist.io/department/chairs\",\n});\n```\n\n## Error Context\n\nWhen capturing errors, you can attach local context to error objects through the `dd_context` attribute, and the RUM SDK will automatically merge it into the final error event context.\n\n```javascript\nconst error = new Error(\"Something went wrong\");\nerror.dd_context = { component: \"Menu\", param: 123 };\nthrow error;\n```\n\n## Global Context\n\nGlobal context is attached to all RUM events and supports the following operations:\n\n- **Add global context attribute**:\n  ```javascript\n  flashcatRum.setGlobalContextProperty(\"activity\", {\n    hasPaid: true,\n    amount: 23.42,\n  });\n  ```\n- **Remove global context attribute**:\n  ```javascript\n  flashcatRum.removeGlobalContextProperty(\"codeVersion\");\n  ```\n- **Replace global context**:\n  ```javascript\n  flashcatRum.setGlobalContext({\n    codeVersion: 34,\n  });\n  ```\n- **Clear global context**:\n  ```javascript\n  flashcatRum.clearGlobalContext();\n  ```\n- **Read global context**:\n  ```javascript\n  const context = flashcatRum.getGlobalContext();\n  ```\n\n### Context Lifecycle\n\nBy default, global context and user context are stored in the current page memory, therefore:\n\n- They are not retained after a complete page refresh.\n- They are not shared between different tabs or windows.\n\nEnabling the `storeContextsAcrossPages` option stores context in `localStorage`, supporting:\n\n- Context retention after page refresh.\n- Context synchronization between tabs under the same domain.\n\n#### Example:\n\n```javascript\nflashcatRum.init({\n  applicationId: \"<YOUR_APPLICATION_ID>\",\n  clientToken: \"<YOUR_CLIENT_TOKEN>\",\n  site: \"flashduty.com\",\n  storeContextsAcrossPages: true,\n});\n```\n\n#### Limitations:\n\n- It is not recommended to store personally identifiable information in context, as `localStorage` data exceeds the user session lifecycle.\n- Not compatible with the `trackSessionAcrossSubdomains` option, as `localStorage` is only shared within the same domain.\n- `localStorage` capacity is limited to 5 MiB, so ensure that the total of application data, Flashduty context, and other third-party data remains within this range.\n\n## Micro-frontend Support\n\nFlashduty RUM supports micro-frontend architecture by identifying event sources through stacktrace mechanism. You need to extract `service` and `version` attributes from application file paths and filenames.\n\n### Usage\n\nOverride `service` and `version` attributes in `beforeSend` based on stack information:\n\n```javascript\nconst SERVICE_REGEX = /some-pathname\\/(?<service>\\w+)\\/(?<version>\\w+)\\//;\n\nflashcatRum.init({\n  applicationId: \"<YOUR_APPLICATION_ID>\",\n  clientToken: \"<YOUR_CLIENT_TOKEN>\",\n  site: \"flashduty.com\",\n  beforeSend: (event, context) => {\n    const stack = context?.handlingStack || event?.error?.stack;\n    const { service, version } = stack?.match(SERVICE_REGEX)?.groups;\n\n    if (service && version) {\n      event.service = service;\n      event.version = version;\n    }\n\n    return true;\n  },\n});\n```\n\nIn the RUM browser, you can filter events using the `service` attribute.\n\n### Limitations\n\nThe following events cannot be attributed to specific sources and therefore do not contain handling stacks:\n\n- Automatically collected action events.\n- Resource events other than XHR and Fetch.\n- View events (can be resolved by overriding view names).\n- CORS and CSP violation events.\n\n## Integrate RUM with Distributed Tracing\n\nIntegrating RUM with distributed tracing allows you to correlate requests from your web and mobile applications with their corresponding backend traces. This combination enables you to view complete frontend and backend data at a glance.\n\nUse frontend data from RUM along with backend, infrastructure, and log information from trace ID injection to identify issues anywhere in your stack and understand user experience.\n\n### Usage\n\nInitialize the RUM SDK. Configure the `allowedTracingUrls` initialization parameter with the list of internal first-party origins called by your browser application.\n\n```javascript\nimport { flashcatRum } from \"@flashcatcloud/browser-rum\";\n\nflashcatRum.init({\n  applicationId: \"<YOUR_APPLICATION_ID>\", // Get from application management page\n  clientToken: \"<YOUR_CLIENT_TOKEN>\", // Get from application management page\n  service: \"<SERVICE_NAME>\", // Service name for distinguishing different services\n  env: \"<ENV_NAME>\", // Environment identifier\n  version: \"1.0.0\", // Application version\n  sessionSampleRate: 100, // Sampling rate\n  allowedTracingUrls: [\n    \"https://api.example.com\",\n    /https:\\/\\/.*\\.my-api-domain\\.com/,\n    (url) => url.startsWith(\"https://api.example.com\"),\n  ], // List of URLs that need to be tracked\n  traceSampleRate: 20, // Optional parameter, percentage of requests to trace: 100 for all, 0 for none. Default value: 100\n});\n```\n\nallowedTracingUrls matches the complete URL (`<scheme>://<host>[:<port>]/<path>[?<query>][#<fragment>]`). It accepts the following types:\n\n- **String:** Matches any URL that starts with this value, for example `https://api.example.com ` matches `https://api.example.com/v1/resource`.\n- **RegExp:** Uses the regex test() method to check if the URL matches.\n- **Function:** Accepts the URL as a parameter and executes the callback function, returning `true` indicates a successful URL match.\n\n## Considerations\n\n- Ensure correct configuration of `applicationId` and `clientToken` to avoid data upload failures.\n- Adjust sampling rate and privacy settings according to application requirements, balancing data volume with compliance.\n- For micro-frontends or complex frontend frameworks, it is recommended to implement `startView` logic at the framework routing level.\n\n## More Information\n\nFor more detailed information about Flashduty RUM, please visit [Flashduty SDK](https://github.com/flashcatcloud/browser-sdk).\n",

Overview — Key Metrics at a Glance\n\n![2025-05-14-11-42-19](https://docs-cdn.flashcat.cloud/images/png/644c1920abde554209568685cda0ea78.png)\n\nThe overview module focuses on the core metrics of your application across multiple dimensions, including:\n\n- **Traffic Metrics**: Monitor PV (page views), UV (unique visitors), and session count to help you grasp overall access trends.\n- **User Distribution**: Combine geographic location, device type, and other information to gain insights into user sources and active regions.\n- **Health and Performance Metrics**: Highlight three browser performance metrics: Largest Contentful Paint, First Input Delay, and Cumulative Layout Shift.\n- **Anomalies and Errors**: Statistics on various error rates to quickly identify potential risk points and ensure application stability.\n\n### 2. Performance Analysis — Comprehensive Control of Application Experience\n\n![2025-05-14-11-56-18](https://docs-cdn.flashcat.cloud/images/png/4a996a5bf76addc6776ffb3865832a35.png)\n\nThe performance analysis module focuses on full-chain monitoring of application loading and interaction experience, including:\n\n- **Page Performance**: Monitor trends and sample distribution of core page loading metrics such as FCP, LCP, CLS, and FCP.\n- **Long Tasks**: A [long animation frame](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/web-platform/long-animation-frames#long-frames-api)  is when a rendering update is delayed beyond 50 milliseconds.\n- **XHR and Fetch Requests**: Analyze the loading performance of XHR and Fetch interfaces to locate slow interfaces.\n- **Static Resources**: Analyze the loading time of static resources to identify performance bottlenecks during application loading.\n\nFor more information about the displayed data, see [Data Collection](https://docs.flashcat.cloud/en/flashduty/rum/data-collection).\n\n### 3. Error Analysis — Fast Location and Diagnosis of Errors\n\n![2025-05-14-11-58-51](https://docs-cdn.flashcat.cloud/images/png/0f684c005cecff6e87d84aceb4ceb1ef.png)\n\nThe error analysis module provides you with comprehensive error monitoring and diagnostic capabilities, including:\n\n- **Page Error Rate**: Pages with the most errors, helping you identify which pages need priority attention.\n- **Top Issues**: Ranking of issues affecting the most users, helping you identify problems that need priority attention. If you need to understand the issue grouping strategy, check [Error Grouping](https://docs.flashcat.cloud/en/flashduty/rum/error-grouping?nav=01JCQ7A4N4WRWNXW8EWEHXCMF5).\n- **Code Errors**: Categorized display of error types. If you need to dig deeper, refer to Error Tracking to investigate critical frontend errors and understand when new errors appear.\n- **API and Resource Errors**: Monitor which APIs and static resources produce the most errors.\n\n### 4. Resource Analysis — Fine-grained Resource Optimization\n\n![2025-05-14-12-00-53](https://docs-cdn.flashcat.cloud/images/png/5b0bfbf8b4aec4418e26d0e158b8d80c.png)\n\nThe resource analysis module helps you identify which resources have the greatest impact on your application:\n\n- **Resource Ranking**: Monitor the most loaded and heaviest resources to identify optimization priorities.\n- **Resource Loading Timeline**: Monitor resource timing trends collected by the browser SDK (DNS resolution, TCP connection, loading time, etc.).\n- **XHR and Fetch Requests**: Distinguish distribution trends of different request types, methods, and error status codes.\n- **Third-party Resources**: Resources where the resource address (host) does not match the current page address (host) are identified as third-party resources.\n\n## Frequently Asked Questions\n\n---\n\n### Why is the size or timing data for some resources 0?\n\n1. **Connection Reuse (Keep-Alive)**: When resource requests use keep-alive to maintain connections, DNS queries and TCP connection processes only occur on the first request, with subsequent requests reusing the same connection, so related data may not be recorded or may be 0.\n\n2. **Cross-origin Resource Loading**: If resources are loaded cross-origin without configuring related header information, the browser cannot collect complete performance data. This is the main reason for missing data.\n\n3. **Browser Compatibility**: In rare cases, some browsers may not support the Performance API, making it impossible to obtain resource-related performance data.\n\n### Why is the `resource_status` for some resources 0?\n\n1. **Cross-origin Resource Loading**: If resources are loaded cross-origin without setting cross-origin access permissions, the browser cannot obtain resource status information.\n\n2. **Browser Compatibility**: Some browsers may not support the Performance API, preventing relevant data collection (extremely rare).\n\n### How to solve missing data for cross-origin resources?\n\n1. Support collecting timing data for cross-origin resources\n\nAdd `Timing-Allow-Origin` to the HTTP response headers of cross-origin resources\n\n```\nTiming-Allow-Origin: *\n```\n\nFor more information on CORS, see [Resource Timing API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Performance_API/Resource_timing#cross-origin_timing_information) in the MDN Web Docs.\n\n2. Support collecting status codes for cross-origin resources\n\n- Add `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` to the HTTP response headers of cross-origin resources\n\n```\nAccess-Control-Allow-Origin: *\n```\n\n- Add crossorigin=\"anonymous\" to the HTML tag referencing the resource, such as:\n\n```html\n<img src=\"https://static.example.com/logo.png\" crossorigin=\"anonymous\" />\n```\n\nFor detailed information, see [Access-Control-Allow-Origin header](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Access-Control-Allow-Origin) and [crossorigin attribute](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes/crossorigin) in the MDN Web Docs.\n\n### How to collect user information\n\n1. **Logged-in User Identification**: For applications requiring user login (such as SaaS products, membership systems, e-commerce platforms, etc.), you can refer to [User Identification Collection](https://docs.flashcat.cloud/en/flashduty/rum/advanced-configuration?nav=01JCQ7A4N4WRWNXW8EWEHXCMF5#user-sessions)\n2. **Device Fingerprint Identification**: For applications without login state (such as corporate websites, marketing pages, public content platforms, etc.), it is recommended to generate stable fingerprints based on browser characteristics, device information, and other multi-dimensional data and report user identifiers\n",

Overview — Key Metrics at a Glance\n\n![2026-01-13-11-46-18](https://docs-cdn.flashcat.cloud/imges/png/84bd82ffe44022ebeaab64a56a1e9ed1.png)\n\nThe overview module focuses on the core metrics of mobile applications across multiple dimensions, including:\n\n- **Traffic Metrics**: Monitor UV (unique visitors) and session count to help you grasp overall user activity trends.\n- **Core Health Metrics**: Highlight three mobile application core metrics: crash count, crash-free rate, and app freeze rate, quickly identifying application stability issues.\n- **User Activity Trends**: Track UV and Session change trends through time-series charts to understand user activity patterns.\n- **User Distribution**: Analyze user sources based on geographic location to understand regional user activity.\n- **Session Analysis**: Track distribution trends of average session duration to evaluate user stickiness and usage depth.\n- **Version Distribution**: Monitor user distribution across different system versions (Android/iOS) and application versions to support compatibility optimization and version iteration.\n\n### 2. Performance Analysis — Comprehensive Control of Application Experience\n\n![2026-01-13-11-47-14](https://docs-cdn.flashcat.cloud/imges/png/ad17864ce4854b7ded905a7a88bdbc87.png)\n\nThe performance analysis module focuses on full-chain monitoring of application startup, page rendering, interaction smoothness, and other core experience metrics, including:\n\n#### Core Performance Metrics\n\nThe top displays P75 values of four key performance metrics:\n\n- **Application Startup Time (P75)**: Monitors the P75 percentile of app startup time to evaluate startup performance. Startup time directly impacts user first impressions and willingness to use.\n- **Frame Rate (P75)**: Shows the P75 percentile of app runtime frame rate to measure screen smoothness. Target is 60fps; higher values indicate smoother interactions.\n- **CPU Consumption (P75)**: Tracks the P75 percentile of CPU usage to identify compute-intensive operations. Excessive CPU consumption leads to device heating and increased power drain.\n- **Memory Usage (P75)**: Monitors the P75 percentile of app memory usage to detect memory leaks or abnormal growth in time.\n\n#### App Startup Time Analysis\n\n- **Startup Time Trend Chart**: Shows app startup time trends over time to help you evaluate startup optimization effectiveness and detect performance regression in time.\n- **Sample Distribution Histogram**: Counts startup time distribution by time intervals (e.g., 0.9425s-0.9642s, 1.1162s-1.1379s), understanding real user startup experience distribution characteristics and identifying long-tail performance issues.\n\n#### View Performance Details\n\nCounts various performance metrics by view name (page/Activity/ViewController):\n\n- **Visit Count**: Shows visit volume for each view, identifying core high-frequency pages.\n- **Startup Time**: Monitors loading time for each view, locating slow-loading pages.\n- **Frame Rate**: Tracks frame rate performance of each view during runtime, identifying rendering performance issues.\n- **CPU Consumption**: Counts CPU usage for each view, optimizing compute-intensive pages.\n- **Memory Usage**: Monitors memory usage for each view, discovering memory leak risks.\n\n#### Smoothness Analysis\n\nCounts app smoothness-related metrics by view name:\n\n- **Slow Frames**: Counts frames with rendering time exceeding threshold (typically 16.67ms, below 60fps), identifying stutter issues. Slow frames cause users to perceive obvious interface unsmoothness.\n- **Frozen Frames**: Records completely frozen interface frames (typically exceeding 700ms), these are serious performance issues significantly affecting user experience.\n- **Long Tasks**: Tracks the number of long-running tasks on the main thread (typically threshold of 100ms or longer), locating performance bottlenecks. Long tasks block user interaction and interface updates.\n- **Freeze Frequency**: Counts app freeze occurrence frequency (times/second), evaluating overall smoothness performance.\n\n#### Memory Analysis\n\nCounts memory usage details by view name:\n\n- **Average Memory**: Shows average memory usage for each view, understanding regular memory consumption levels.\n- **Peak Memory**: Records memory usage peaks during view runtime, identifying memory pressure peaks to prevent system termination due to insufficient memory (OOM).\n- **P75 Memory**: Shows P75 percentile of memory usage, reflecting memory usage for most users, more representative of real experience than average values.\n\nFor detailed performance metric descriptions, see [Android Data Collection](../2.%20SDK%20Integration/Android/3.%20Data%20Collection.md) and [iOS Data Collection](../2.%20SDK%20Integration/iOS/3.%20Data%20Collection.md).\n\n### 3. Error Analysis — Fast Location and Diagnosis of Errors\n\n![2026-01-13-11-48-16](https://docs-cdn.flashcat.cloud/imges/png/b5868b87e52ddc7b82c61f685b2d0bd9.png)\n\nThe error analysis module provides you with comprehensive error monitoring and diagnostic capabilities, including:\n\n#### Core Stability Metrics\n\n- **Crash Count**: Monitors total app crash occurrences and trends, detecting abnormal peaks in time. Crashes force apps to exit, seriously affecting user experience.\n- **Crash-free Rate**: Tracks the proportion of crash-free sessions, evaluating overall app stability performance. Industry standards recommend maintaining crash-free rate above 99.5%.\n- **ANR Rate**: Counts Android Application Not Responding occurrence proportion. ANR indicates app main thread blocked for more than 5 seconds, users see \"Application Not Responding\" dialog.\n- **App Freeze Rate**: Monitors the proportion of sessions with freezes out of total sessions, evaluating the impact scope of app smoothness issues.

Resource Analysis — Fine-grained Network Performance Optimization\n\n![2026-01-13-11-48-55](https://docs-cdn.flashcat.cloud/imges/png/97a80ff169a3c3e625e1c2e6d9d6a5b8.png)\n\nThe resource analysis module helps you deeply understand app network request performance and identify optimization opportunities:\n\n- **Request Count**: Monitors network request volume change trends, understanding app network activity.\n- **Request Success Rate**: Tracks proportion of successful requests, detecting network anomalies in time.\n- **Median Request Time**: Shows median request duration changes (e.g., p50, p75, p95), evaluating overall network performance level.\n- **Slow Requests**: Counts slow request trends with response time exceeding threshold, locating performance bottlenecks.\n- **Abnormal Requests**: Monitors failed or error request occurrences, quickly identifying API issues.\n- **Request Status Distribution**:\n  - **Request Status Code Proportion**: Shows distribution of different HTTP status codes through pie chart (e.g., 200, 404, 500), identifying abnormal request types.\n  - **Request Status Code Trend**: Monitors status code changes over time, detecting abnormal peaks in time.\n- **Request Method Distribution**:\n  - **Request Method Proportion**: Shows usage distribution of different HTTP methods (GET, POST, etc.).\n  - **Request Method Trend**: Analyzes time-series changes of each request method.\n- **Static Resources**:\n  - **Static Resource Call Ranking**: Lists most frequently called static resources (e.g., images, fonts, config files), understanding resource usage popularity.\n  - **Static Resource Response Ranking**: Identifies slowest responding static resources, optimizing resource loading performance.\n- **Network Call Ranking**:\n  - **Host Ranking**: Counts request count by request source (Host), identifying main dependent service endpoints.\n  - **Resource Duration Ranking**: Lists longest duration network requests, including duration details (DNS resolution, TCP connection, SSL handshake, first byte time, response time, etc.), precisely locating performance bottlenecks.\n\n## Frequently Asked Questions\n\n---\n\n### Why is the status code for some network requests 0?\n\n1. **Request Canceled**: User left page or canceled operation before request completion, causing request interruption.\n2. **Network Interruption or Timeout**: Request encountered network interruption, timeout, or other exceptions during sending, possibly causing status code not to return normally.\n3. **Certificate Verification Failed**: HTTPS request SSL certificate verification failed, connection interrupted before establishment.\n4. **SDK Compatibility**: In rare cases, specific system versions or devices may have compatibility issues, causing incomplete data collection.\n\n### What is the difference between error count and Issue count?\n\n- **Error Count**: Refers to total count of raw error events, including every error occurrence record.\n- **Issue Count**: Refers to count of problems after aggregation. Flashduty aggregates similar errors into the same Issue based on error stack, error type, occurrence location, and other information.\n\n**Example**:\n\n- Total Error Count: 100\n- Issue Count: 5\n\nThis indicates that 100 errors were aggregated into 5 different Issues, each possibly caused by different root causes.\n\n**Why aggregation is needed**:\n\n- Facilitate locating problem root cause: errors with same root cause grouped into one Issue, avoiding duplicate processing\n- Priority sorting: identify problems most needing fixes through impact scope (error count, session count)\n- Track fix effectiveness: after fixing one Issue, observe whether all errors under that Issue disappear\n\nLearn more about [Error Grouping Strategy](https://docs.flashcat.cloud/en/flashduty/rum/error-grouping).\n\n### How to improve crash-free rate?\n\n1. **Locate High-frequency Crashes**: Quickly locate most impactful crash issues through \"Page Crash Ranking\" and \"Top Issues\".\n2. **Analyze Stack Information**: Click specific Issue to view detailed error stack and user environment information, precisely locating problem code.\n3. **Focus on System Compatibility**: Identify specific system version compatibility issues through \"System Crash Distribution\".\n4. **Monitor Version Quality**: Evaluate new version quality through \"Version Distribution\", perform hot fixes or rollbacks when necessary.\n5. **Enhance Exception Capture**: Properly use try-catch, global exception handlers to avoid uncaught exceptions causing crashes.\n\n### How to optimize app startup performance?\n\n1. **Analyze Startup Data**:\n   - View \"Application Startup Time (P75)\" metric to understand most users' startup experience\n   - Evaluate optimization effectiveness through \"Startup Time Trend Chart\", avoiding performance regression\n   - View \"Sample Distribution Histogram\" to identify long-tail issues, ensuring minority users also get good experience\n\n2. **Delay Non-critical Initialization**: Defer non-essential initialization operations until after first screen render to shorten startup time.\n\n3. **Optimize Dependency Loading**: Reduce third-party SDKs and libraries loaded during startup, adopt lazy loading strategy.\n\n4. **Simplify First Screen Layout**: Reduce homepage view hierarchy complexity, decrease first render time.\n\n5. **Use Startup Optimization Tools**:\n   - Android: Use App Startup Library to manage component initialization order\n   - iOS: Utilize Lazy Initialization to defer non-critical component initialization\n\n6. **Monitor Startup Phase Duration**: Track duration of each phase through custom timing points, precisely locating bottleneck stages.\n\n### What do P75, P50, P90 percentiles mean?\n\nPercentiles are important metrics in statistics for measuring data distribution:\n\n- **P50 (Median)**: 50% of users have better experience than this value, 50% have worse\n- **P75**: 75% of users have better experience than this value, 25% have worse\n- **P90**: 90% of users have better experience than this value, 10% have worse\n- **P95**: 95% of users have better experience than this value, 5% have worse\n\n**Why use P75 instead of average?**\n\n- Average values are easily affected by extreme values and may not represent most users' real experience\n- P75 better reflects most users' experience, is an industry-standard performance evaluation metric\n- Google recommends using P75 as a core performance metric\n\n**Example**:\n\n- App startup time P75 = 1.7s: indicates 75% of users have startup time within 1.7s, 25% exceed 1.7s\n- Memory usage P75 = 233MB: indicates 75% of scenarios have memory usage within 233MB\n\n### What are slow frames, frozen frames, and long tasks?\n\nThese are all important metrics for measuring app smoothness:\n\n**Slow Frame**:\n\n- Frame with rendering time exceeding 16.67ms (60fps standard)\n- Users perceive slight stutter\n- Acceptable occasionally, needs optimization if frequent\n\n**Frozen Frame**:\n\n- Frame with rendering time exceeding 700ms\n- Interface completely frozen, users cannot interact\n- Seriously affects user experience, must fix\n\n**Long Task**:\n\n- Task executing on main thread for more than 100ms\n- Blocks user interaction and interface updates\n- Common causes: complex calculations, large data processing, synchronous I/O\n\n**Optimization Recommendations**:\n\n- Move time-consuming operations to background threads\n- Process large amounts of data in batches\n- Optimize algorithm complexity\n- Avoid synchronous network requests or disk I/O on main thread\n\n### How to improve page loading performance?\n\n1. **Locate Slow Pages**: Identify slowest loading pages through \"Page Loading Duration Ranking\", prioritize optimization.\n\n2. **Optimize Data Loading**:\n   - Adopt pagination loading or virtual list technology, avoid loading large amounts of data at once\n   - Use data preloading and caching strategies to reduce wait time\n   - Optimize network requests, merge API calls\n\n3. **Simplify Page Layout**:\n   -

Use appropriate image formats and sizes\n   - Adopt progressive loading or placeholder images\n   - Compress and cache images\n\n5. **Asynchronous Rendering**: Execute complex view rendering operations on background threads.\n\n### What is ANR, and how to reduce ANR rate?\n\n**ANR (Application Not Responding)** is Android system's application unresponsive mechanism:\n\n- When app main thread is blocked for more than 5 seconds, system pops up \"Application Not Responding\" dialog\n- User can choose \"Wait\" or \"Close App\"\n- ANR seriously affects user experience, may cause user to uninstall app\n\n**Common ANR Causes**:\n\n1. **Main Thread Executing Time-consuming Operations**:\n   - Synchronous network requests\n   - Large file read/write\n   - Complex calculations\n   - Database operations\n\n2. **Main Thread Waiting for Locks**:\n   - Deadlock between threads\n   - Waiting for other threads to release locks\n\n3. **Insufficient System Resources**:\n   - CPU occupied by other apps\n   - Insufficient memory causing frequent GC\n\n**How to Reduce ANR Rate**:\n\n1. **Avoid Main Thread Blocking**:\n   - Move time-consuming operations to background threads (use AsyncTask, Coroutines, RxJava, etc.)\n   - Use asynchronous APIs instead of synchronous APIs\n   - Avoid network requests and file I/O on main thread\n\n2. **Optimize Lock Usage**:\n   - Reduce lock holding time\n   - Avoid nested locks\n   - Use lock-free data structures\n\n3. **Optimize Lifecycle Methods**:\n   - Lifecycle methods like onCreate/onResume should return quickly\n   - Delay loading of non-critical resources\n\n4. **Monitoring and Analysis**:\n   - Use StrictMode to discover main thread violations during development\n   - Locate issues through RUM dashboard's \"Long Task Count\" and \"Freeze Frequency\"\n   - View ANR stack information to locate specific code\n\n### How to reduce app freeze rate?\n\n1. **Locate Freeze Sources**: Identify specific code causing freezes through \"Long Task Monitoring\" and \"Freeze Duration Distribution\".\n\n2. **Optimize Main Thread Tasks**: Move time-consuming operations (like network requests, database read/write, complex calculations, large file I/O) to background threads.\n\n3. **Optimize UI Rendering**:\n   - Reduce view hierarchy, lower layout complexity\n   - Avoid complex view calculations on main thread\n   - Use optimization techniques for RecyclerView (Android) or UITableView/UICollectionView (iOS)\n   - Properly use hardware acceleration\n\n4. **Optimize List Performance**:\n   - Implement view reuse mechanism\n   - Optimize item layout complexity\n   - Avoid time-consuming operations during item binding\n\n5. **Combine Monitoring Tools**: Use performance analysis dashboard in combination with system tools (Android Profiler, Xcode Instruments) to locate specific freeze code.\n\n6. **Set Reasonable Thresholds**: Set reasonable freeze detection thresholds (recommended 200-500ms) based on business characteristics and user expectations.\n\n### How to collect user information?\n\n1. **Logged-in User Identification**: For apps requiring user login (e.g., e-commerce, social, finance), you can call SDK's user identification method after user login:\n   - Android: Refer to [Android User Session Configuration](https://docs.flashcat.cloud/en/flashduty/rum/android/advanced-configuration#user-sessions)\n   - iOS: Refer to [iOS User Session Configuration](https://docs.flashcat.cloud/en/flashduty/rum/ios/advanced-configuration#user-sessions)\n\n2. **Device Fingerprint Identification**: For apps without login state, recommend generating stable device fingerprints based on device information and reporting user identifiers:\n   - **Android**: Can use Android ID, IMEI (requires permission), Advertising ID, etc.\n   - **iOS**: Can use IDFV (Identifier for Vendor) or IDFA (requires user authorization)\n\n### How to optimize network request performance?\n\n1. **Identify Slow Requests**: Locate longest response time APIs through \"Resource Duration Ranking\".\n\n2. **Analyze Duration Distribution**: View duration of each phase like DNS resolution, TCP connection, SSL handshake, first byte time to precisely locate bottlenecks.\n\n3. **Optimization Recommendations**:\n   - DNS optimization: Use DNS caching, HTTPDNS\n   - Connection optimization: Enable HTTP/2, connection reuse, reduce redirects\n   - Transfer optimization: Enable GZIP compression, optimize data format, reduce request size\n   - API optimization: Optimize backend API performance, use CDN to accelerate static resources\n\n### What is the data latency?\n\nFlashduty RUM typically completes collection and display within 1-3 minutes after data generation. Under good network conditions, most data can achieve near real-time updates.\n\n## Further Reading\n\n---\n\n### SDK Integration and Configuration\n\n- [Android SDK Integration Guide](../2.%20SDK%20Integration/Android/1.%20SDK%20Integration.md) - Learn how to integrate RUM SDK in Android apps\n- [iOS SDK Integration Guide](../2.%20SDK%20Integration/iOS/1.%20SDK%20Integration.md) - Learn how to integrate RUM SDK in iOS apps\n- [Android Advanced Configuration](../2.%20SDK%20Integration/Android/2.%20Advanced%20Configuration.md) - In-depth configuration of Android RUM SDK advanced features\n- [iOS Advanced Configuration](../2.%20SDK%20Integration/iOS/2.%20Advanced%20Configuration.md) - In-depth configuration of iOS RUM SDK advanced features\n- [Android Data Collection](../2.%20SDK%20Integration/Android/3.%20Data%20Collection.md) - Understand data types collected by Android RUM SDK\n- [iOS Data Collection](../2.%20SDK%20Integration/iOS/3.%20Data%20Collection.md) - Understand data types collected by iOS RUM SDK\n\n### Data Analysis and Monitoring\n\n- [RUM Explorer Usage Guide](https://docs.flashcat.cloud/en/flashduty/rum/explorer) - Learn how to use RUM Explorer for in-depth data analysis\n- [Error Tracking](https://docs.flashcat.cloud/en/flashduty/rum/error-tracking) - Master error tracking and debugging techniques\n- [Error Grouping Strategy](https://docs.flashcat.cloud/en/flashduty/rum/error-grouping) - Understand error aggregation mechanism\n\n### Performance Optimization\n\n- [Android Performance Optimization Best Practices](https://docs.flashcat.cloud/en/flashduty/rum/android/performance-optimization)\n- [iOS Performance Optimization Best Practices](https://docs.flashcat.cloud/en/flashduty/rum/ios/performance-optimization)\n",

In Flashduty RUM, an Issue is composed of a group of similar errors, typically related to the same bug. Detailed grouping rules can be found in [Error Grouping](https://docs.flashcat.cloud/en/flashduty/rum/error-grouping?nav=01JCQ7A4N4WRWNXW8EWEHXCMF5). In the list, you can view and filter errors, and further locate problems by examining the context and stack information provided in the details.\n\n![2025-05-15-15-52-09](https://docs-cdn.flashcat.cloud/imges/png/7eaffcd3d631d03ffb553f8956ff94ac.png)\n\n### Issue Information Overview\n\n![2025-05-15-19-29-45](https://docs-cdn.flashcat.cloud/imges/png/5fb33aa6b0283515ca9f2427ae4aff27.png)\n\nEach entry listed in the Issue browser contains the following information:\n\n- Error type and error message\n- File path where the error occurred\n- Service name\n- Error cause\n- Whether the issue has recurred\n- Important information about the Issue lifecycle:\n  - First and last occurrence times\n  - Occurrence frequency chart over time\n  - Number of occurrences within the selected time period\n\n### Issue Status\n\nIssues have 4 statuses: \"Pending\", \"In Progress\", \"Resolved\", and \"Ignored\". Their transition flow is as follows, where issue recurrence-related transition logic can be found at [Issue States](https://docs.flashcat.cloud/zh/flashduty/rum/issue-state?nav=01JCQ7A4N4WRWNXW8EWEHXCMF5)\n![2025-05-15-16-09-20](https://docs-cdn.flashcat.cloud/imges/png/d81cfab46793c24b044c8d87ef30402b.png)\n\n### Time Range\n\nThe browser displays a timeline in the upper right corner, allowing you to display Issues with errors that occurred within a selected time period. You can change the time range by selecting a preset range from the dropdown menu. You can also modify the time directly or use natural language for filtering.\n\n<!-- ![2025-05-15-19-33-18](https://docs-cdn.flashcat.cloud/imges/png/209a8a433ca5a2d5681865ff1e3c08f4.png) -->\n\n### Sorting Method\n\nYou can sort the Issue list using the following options:\n\n- **Update Time**: Sort by issue update time (default sorting).\n- **Creation Time**: Sort by when the issue was first discovered.\n- **Occurrence Count**: Sort by the total number of error occurrences within the selected time range.\n- **Affected Session Count**: Sort by the number of affected RUM sessions.\n\n### Filters\n\nFlashduty RUM automatically establishes predefined attribute indexes for your Issues and creates corresponding filters. Each filter displays all different values for that attribute within the selected time period and provides basic analysis, such as error causes, environments, etc. Filters allow you to categorize or filter Issues based on specific attributes.\n\n![2025-05-15-19-34-43](https://docs-cdn.flashcat.cloud/imges/png/718ff0527731fd89465a3a7e0fb7c7ea.png)\nCurrently supported attributes include:\n\n| Attribute | Description |\n| --------- | ----------- |\n| Error Cause | Possible root cause type when the error occurred |\n| Environment | The `env` field when the Issue was reported |\n| Service | The `service` field when the Issue was reported |\n| Error Type | The `error.type` field in the reported error event |\n| Error Message | The `error.message` field in the error event, supports fuzzy matching |\n| IssueID | ID assigned during Issue grouping, multiple IDs can be separated by commas |\n| Issue Recurrence | If a resolved issue occurs again, the Issue will be marked as recurred |\n| Fingerprint | Fingerprint information during Issue grouping, multiple fingerprints can be separated by commas |\n\nClick the \"+Filter\" button to view all filters and add, modify, or delete conditions.\n\n### Error Causes\n\nFlashcat adds a classification of possible error causes each time an issue is created. This initially added error type helps improve the efficiency of fault localization and facilitates Issue filtering and priority sorting. You can modify the error classification reason as needed during subsequent browsing. When you hover over the error cause classification, the system will further provide inferred root causes and repair suggestions for reference by combining AI capabilities.\n\n<!-- ![2025-05-15-19-36-04](https://docs-cdn.flashcat.cloud/imges/png/24c6db8dd8d125edf81b7fba3d8d2f6b.png) -->\n\nError causes are classified as follows:\n\n- Code Error: Errors caused by code defects.\n- Illegal Object Access: Code accessing null or undefined objects.\n- Invalid Parameter: Calling functions with invalid parameters.\n- Network Error: Server response time too long or slow network speed.\n- API Request Failure: API endpoint returned an error status code.\n- Unknown Error: The error type cannot be located.\n\n### Issue Recurrence\n\nIssue Recurrence (Regression) refers to a previously fixed bug occurring again. In Flashduty, if an error has been marked as resolved but the same error occurs again later (with a different version), the Issue status will reopen from the end state and be marked as \"Issue Recurred\". You can view information about recurred Issues in the list.\n\n![2025-05-15-19-35-36](https://docs-cdn.flashcat.cloud/imges/png/489e8b51c598fc2ef0a248508dd546d6.png)\n\n## Issue Details\n\nClick on any Issue to open the details panel for more information.\n![2025-05-15-19-48-34](https://docs-cdn.flashcat.cloud/imges/png/964b9102aca07b4e68b569acf1d99891.png)\n\n### Basic Information\n\nThe upper part of the panel displays basic information about the Issue, such as status, error cause, etc. You can also learn about the Issue's lifecycle: when the Issue first and last appeared, its duration, and the number of error occurrences over time (aggregated at a certain time granularity).\n\n### Tag Distribution\n\nIn the tag distribution section, you can view the proportion of different tags under this Issue across various dimensions, helping you quickly determine the scope of impact and assist in locating the root cause. Currently supported tags include `view_name`, `browser_name`, `version`, `env`, etc.\n\n### Error Samples\n\nBy default, the most recent error information reported during the current Issue occurrence is displayed as an error sample. You can also switch using the navigation bar.\n\n#### Error Stack\n\nYou can view the error's context information and stack information. If you have uploaded source code, you can see the stack information when the exception occurred. You can view your uploaded source code information in \"Application Management\" - \"Source Code Management\". See [Source Mapping](https://docs.flashcat.cloud/en/flashduty/rum/sourcemap?nav=01JCQ7A4N4WRWNXW8EWEHXCMF5) for detailed instructions.\n![2025-05-15-19-49-29](https://docs-cdn.flashcat.cloud/imges/png/551f3fdc7eef25ac2888f71db87b9f69.png)\n\n### Session Timeline\n\nYou can see the total number of Session events for the current error example and view the user's resource access and operation information before and after the exception occurred.\n:::tip\nCurrently, a maximum of 20 contextual information items, including the current Error event, are displayed to help define the exception. Later, you can view more log information in the Session Viewer module.\n:::\n\n### Properties\n\nWhen exception events are reported, they carry a series of properties. You can view various information such as the current Session, view, user, etc. in the properties section to help troubleshoot problems.\n\n## Exception Alerts\n\nDiscovering problems as soon as they occur gives you the opportunity to proactively identify and fix them before they become serious. Exception tracking monitoring allows you to track any new issues or issues that have a significant impact on your system or users. You can edit by selecting the application card in \"Application Management\", enable \"Alerts\", and select the collaboration space for notifications. See [Issue Alerting](https://docs.flashcat.cloud/en/flashduty/rum/issue-alerting?nav=01JCQ7A4N4WRWNXW8EWEHXCMF5) for specific instructions.\n![2025-05-15-19-50-31](https://docs-cdn.flashcat.cloud/imges/png/eebe04d7a964b0dfaafd87daa9b6a345.png)\n\n## Best Practices\n\n1. **Configure Source Mapping**: Facilitates problem localization in the production environment\n2. **Add User Information**: Configure user-related information to provide better error context\n3. **Set Alert Strategies**: Configure reasonable collaboration spaces and dispatch strategies for errors\n4. **Regular Error Analysis**: Regularly check error reports to discover potential problems\n5. **Team Collaboration**: Use team ownership features to ensure issues can be quickly assigned to relevant teams\n6. **Monitor Regressions**: Closely monitor potential regressions of resolved issues\n\nBy properly using Flashduty RUM's error tracking features, you can quickly discover and resolve issues, providing a stable and reliable user experience.\n\n## Next Steps\n\n- [Source Mapping](https://docs.flashcat.cloud/en/flashduty/rum/sourcemap?nav=01JCQ7A4N4WRWNXW8EWEHXCMF5)\n- [Error Grouping](https://docs.flashcat.cloud/en/flashduty/rum/error-grouping?nav=01JCQ7A4N4WRWNXW8EWEHXCMF5)\n- [Issue Status](https://docs.flashcat.cloud/en/flashduty/rum/issue-states?nav=01JCQ7A4N4WRWNXW8EWEHXCMF5) ",

The grouping process is as follows:\n\n1. **Fingerprint Matching**: Obtains the fingerprint of the error event and compares it with the fingerprints of existing issues.\n2. **Automatic Merging**: If the new event shares the same fingerprint with an existing issue, it is automatically assigned to that issue.\n3. **Similarity Analysis**: If no fingerprint match is found, machine learning models analyze error similarity, assigning the event to the most similar issue or creating a new issue if similarity is too low.\n\n## Default Fingerprinting\n\nFlashduty enables error grouping by default, without requiring additional configuration to start working. The Browser SDK automatically collects error data and performs grouping. Below are the basic settings for web environments:\n\n1. **Integrate Flashduty Browser SDK**\n\n   Include the Flashduty Browser SDK in your HTML file:\n\n   ```html\n   <script src=\"https://cdn.flashcat.com/rum-browser-sdk.js\"></script>\n   ```\n\n2. **Initialize SDK**\n\n   When initializing the SDK, specify the application ID and environment:\n\n   ```javascript\n   window.FLASHCAT_RUM.init({\n     applicationId: \"rum-application-id\",\n     environment: \"production\",\n     version: \"1.0.0\",\n   });\n   ```\n\n3. **Fingerprint Calculation**\n\n   When an error event doesn't carry a fingerprint, Flashduty automatically calculates a fingerprint based on the following error properties:\n\n   - **service**: The service where the error occurred.\n   - **env**: The environment where the error occurred.\n   - **error.type**: The type classification of the error.\n   - **error.message**: The descriptive text of the error.\n\n:::tip\nTo improve grouping accuracy, Flashduty removes variable attributes from stack frames, such as version numbers, IDs, dates, and other dynamic parameters.\n:::\n\n## Custom Fingerprinting\n\nIf default grouping doesn't meet your needs, you can take complete control of error grouping behavior by providing custom fingerprints. Custom fingerprints take precedence over default fingerprints.\n\n1. **Manually Add Custom Fingerprints**\n\n   When manually reporting errors, add custom fingerprints through `addError`:\n\n   ```javascript\n   window.FLASHCAT_RUM.addError(new Error(\"My error message\"), {\n     source: \"custom\",\n     fingerprint: \"my-custom-grouping-fingerprint\",\n   });\n   ```\n\n2. **Use beforeSend Callback**\n\n   Dynamically set fingerprints through the `beforeSend` callback:\n\n   ```javascript\n   window.FLASHCAT_RUM.init({\n     applicationId: \"rum-application-id\",\n     environment: \"production\",\n     beforeSend: (event) => {\n       if (event.type === \"error\") {\n         event.error.fingerprint = \"my-custom-grouping-fingerprint\";\n       }\n       return true;\n     },\n   });\n   ```\n\n:::tip\n\n- Custom fingerprints must be string type.\n- Errors with the same fingerprint in the same service will be grouped into the same issue.\n- Errors from different services will be grouped into different issues even if they have the same fingerprint.\n- The `beforeSend` callback can also be used to filter out irrelevant errors (such as third-party script errors).\n  :::\n\n## Web-Specific Considerations\n\n- **SourceMap Integration**:\n\n  - Upload `sourcemap` files to decode compressed stack traces, ensuring that error stacks in aggregated issues can be mapped to original source code.\n  - Example: Use `flashcat-cli` to upload `sourcemaps`:\n    ```bash\n    flashcat-cli sourcemaps upload --service my-service --release-version 1.0.0 --minified-path-prefix /assets --api-key your-api-key ./dist\n    ```\n\n- **Third-Party Script Errors**:\n  - By default, Flashduty filters out errors from browser extensions or third-party scripts (such as those with `network` origin) to reduce noise.\n  - You can further customize filtering rules through `beforeSend`:\n    ```javascript\n    beforeSend: (event) => {\n      if (\n        event.error.source === \"network\" &&\n        event.error.message.includes(\"ThirdPartyScript\")\n      ) {\n        return false; // Discard this error\n      }\n      return true;\n    };\n    ```\n\n## Viewing and Analyzing Grouping Results\n\nOn the Flashduty platform, navigate to \"Error Tracking\" to view the list of aggregated issues. Each issue includes:\n\n- Error messages and stack traces (if `sourcemaps` were uploaded, original source code locations will be displayed).\n- User session timeline.\n- Metadata (such as browser type, version number).\n\n## Next Steps\n\n- [Issue Status](https://docs.flashcat.cloud/en/flashduty/rum/issue-states?nav=01JCQ7A4N4WRWNXW8EWEHXCMF5)\n",

Through `sourcemaps`, frontend developers can track and debug errors more efficiently. Users can view uploaded `sourcemap` files in the \"Application Management\" - \"Source Management\" menu, and generate scripts for local execution through the upload panel. This document will provide detailed information about the purpose of `sourcemaps`, methods for generating and uploading them, management approaches, and how to use `sourcemaps` in the error tracking module to precisely locate issues.\n\n## Why Do We Need SourceMaps?\n\nIn modern frontend development, JavaScript and CSS files are often compressed and minified to optimize loading speed and performance. However, this compression makes it difficult to trace error locations (such as line and column numbers) in the original source code, increasing debugging difficulty. `SourceMap` files solve this problem:\n\n- **Mapping Minified Code to Source Code**: `SourceMaps` record the mapping relationship between compressed code and original code, allowing developers to view uncompressed source code during debugging.\n- **Precise Error Location**: Through `SourceMaps`, you can directly locate specific positions in the original source code when tracking errors, not just in the compressed files.\n- **Improved Debugging Efficiency**: Developers don't need to manually decode compressed files, saving time in troubleshooting.\n\n## How to Generate and Upload SourceMaps?\n\n### Generating SourceMaps\n\nMost modern build tools (such as Webpack, Rollup, or Vite) support generating `SourceMaps`. Here's an example configuration using Webpack:\n\n1. Enable `SourceMap` generation in `webpack.config.js`:\n\n```javascript\nmodule.exports = {\n  mode: \"production\",\n  devtool: \"source-map\", // Generate separate .map files\n  output: {\n    filename: \"bundle.js\",\n    path: path.resolve(__dirname, \"dist\"),\n  },\n};\n```\n\n2. After building, the `dist` directory will contain `bundle.js` and its corresponding `bundle.js.map` file.\n\n### Uploading SourceMaps Using Flashduty CLI\n\nFlashduty CLI provides the `sourcemaps` command for uploading `sourcemap` files to the Flashduty server. Here are the specific steps:\n\n1. **Install Flashduty CLI**\n\n   Ensure Node.js is installed, then install `flashcat-cli` via npm:\n\n   ```bash\n   npm install -g @flashcloud/flashcat-cli\n   ```\n\n2. **Configure API Key and Service Information**\n   ![2025-06-24-17-20-59](https://docs-cdn.flashcat.cloud/imges/png/03c8b8922e101dc0b14cfdf60d3e08cf.png)\n   In the **Application Management - Source Management** menu, click the \"Upload Source\" panel, fill in the following information, and generate an upload script:\n\n   - **API Key**: Used to authenticate your identity (e.g., `test2`).\n   - **Service Name**: The service name of your application (e.g., `my-service`).\n   - **Version Number**: The release version of your application (e.g., `1.0.0`).\n   - **Minified File Prefix**: The path prefix for compressed files (e.g., `/assets`).\n\n   Example generated script:\n\n   ```bash\n   flashcat-cli sourcemaps upload \\\n     --service my-service \\\n     --release-version 1.0.0 \\\n     --minified-path-prefix /assets \\\n     --api-key test2\n   ```\n\n3. **Execute Upload**\n\n   Run the generated script in your project root directory, ensuring the `sourcemap` files are located in the specified path (such as the `dist` directory). Flashduty CLI will upload the `sourcemap` files to the server.\n\n   ```bash\n   flashcat-cli sourcemaps upload --service my-service --release-version 1.0.0 --minified-path-prefix /assets --api-key test2 ./dist\n   ```\n\n   **Note**:\n\n   - Ensure the `minified-path-prefix` matches the actual deployed path of your compressed files.\n   - After successful upload, you can view the uploaded `sourcemap` files in **Application Management - Source Management**.\n\n## How to Manage SourceMaps?\n\nOn the Flashduty platform, `sourcemap` files are managed through the **Application Management - Source Management** menu:\n\n- **View Uploaded SourceMaps**: The menu lists all uploaded `sourcemap` files, including file paths, service names, version numbers, sizes, and upload times.\n- **Version Management**: Through the `service` and `release-version` parameters, you can manage `sourcemaps` for different versions of your application, facilitating parallel debugging across multiple versions.\n- **Permission Control**: Through the `API Key`, only authorized users can upload or manage `sourcemaps`.\n\n## How to View Source Code in the Error Tracking Module?\n\nFlashduty RUM (Real User Monitoring) integrates `sourcemap` functionality, supporting direct viewing of original source code in the error tracking module for precise issue location. Here's the workflow:\n\n1. **Capture Frontend Errors**\n\n   Flashduty RUM SDK automatically captures frontend errors (such as JavaScript exceptions, Promise rejections, network errors, etc.) and sends error stack information to the server.\n\n   Example: Automatically capture unhandled exceptions\n\n   ```javascript\n   throw new Error(\"Something went wrong\");\n   ```\n\n2. **Associate SourceMaps**\n\n   When the file paths and line numbers in the error stack match with uploaded `sourcemaps`, Flashduty automatically maps the error location in compressed code to the original source code.\n\n   For example, an error stack from compressed file `/assets/index-5e0391ac.js`:\n\n   ```\n   Error: Something went wrong\n       at Object.<anonymous> (/assets/index-5e0391ac.js:1:123)\n   ```\n\n   Through `sourcemap`, mapped to original source code `src/components/App.js`:\n\n   ```\n   Error: Something went wrong\n       at App.render (src/components/App.js:45:10)\n   ```\n\n3. **View Error Details**\n\n   In the Flashduty error tracking module, click on a specific error record to view the following information:\n\n   - **Error Message**: Such as `Something went wrong`.\n   - **Original Stack**: Mapped source code file paths, line numbers, and column numbers (e.g., `src/components/App.js:45:10`).\n   - **Context Code**: Displays source code snippets around the error location, facilitating quick problem identification.\n\n4. **Debug and Fix**\n\n   Based on the mapped source code location, developers can directly find the corresponding code in their local development environment, analyze the root cause, and fix the issue.\n\n## Best Practices\n\n1. **Standardize SourceMap Upload**:\n\n   - Integrate the `flashcat-cli sourcemaps upload` command into your CI/CD pipeline to ensure automatic upload of `sourcemaps` with each release.\n   - Example (GitHub Actions):\n     ```yaml\n     - name: Upload SourceMaps\n       run: flashcat-cli sourcemaps upload --service my-service --release-version ${{ github.sha }} --minified-path-prefix /assets --api-key ${{ secrets.FLASHCAT_API_KEY }} ./dist\n     ```\n\n2. **Version Management**:\n\n   - Use the `--release-version` parameter consistent with your application version number for easier tracking of specific `sourcemap` versions.\n\n3. **Clean Source Code**:\n\n   - Delete `sourcemap` files before uploading resources to CDN to avoid including source code information in the production environment.\n\n4. **Test Mapping Effect**:\n   - After uploading `sourcemaps`, proactively throw test errors to verify if the error tracking module can correctly map to source code.\n\n## Common Issues\n\n### 1. Why isn't the error stack mapping to source code?\n\n- Confirm that `sourcemaps` were successfully uploaded and that the `minified-path-prefix` matches the actual deployment path.\n- Check if the `service` and `release-version` match the application version when the error occurred.\n\n### 2. How to prevent SourceMaps from leaking sensitive information?\n\n- Ensure `sourcemap` files are only uploaded to the Flashduty server and not directly exposed on the public internet.\n- In production environments, remove direct access to `sourcemap` files (e.g., through Nginx configuration).\n\n### 3. What if uploading SourceMaps fails?\n\n- Check if the `API Key` is valid.\n- Ensure network connection is normal and the CLI version is up-to-date.\n\n## Next Steps\n\n- [Error Grouping](https://docs.flashcat.cloud/en/flashduty/rum/error-grouping?nav=01JCQ7A4N4WRWNXW8EWEHXCMF5)\n- [Issue Status](https://docs.flashcat.cloud/en/flashduty/rum/issue-states?nav=01JCQ7A4N4WRWNXW8EWEHXCMF5)\n",

These issues may cause page functionality to fail, severely affecting user experience.\n\n### Network Errors\n\nMonitors communication issues with backend services or third-party APIs:\n\n- XHR/Fetch request failures\n- Request timeouts\n- Cross-origin (CORS) errors\n- HTTP 4xx/5xx status codes\n\n### Resource Loading Errors\n\nMonitors cases where web page resources fail to load:\n\n- Image loading failures\n- Script loading failures\n- Stylesheet loading failures\n- Font file loading failures\n\n### Custom Errors\n\nIn addition to automatically captured errors, you can manually report custom errors using the RUM SDK to track specific issues such as business logic errors.\n\n## Reporting Methods\n\n### Automatic Error Capture\n\nFlashduty RUM SDK automatically captures the following types of browser errors:\n\n- **Uncaught exceptions**: JavaScript exceptions thrown at runtime (such as `TypeError`, `ReferenceError`).\n- **Unhandled Promise rejections**: Promise errors not handled by `.catch()`.\n- **Network errors**: XHR or Fetch request failures (such as 4xx, 5xx status codes or network interruptions).\n- **React rendering errors**: Exceptions during React component rendering (requires error boundaries).\n\n:::tip\n\n- Automatically captured errors include stack traces, error messages, and source information by default.\n- Errors from browser extensions or third-party scripts (such as `network` source) are filtered to avoid data pollution.\n  :::\n\n### Manual Error Reporting\n\nThrough the `addError` API, you can manually report handled exceptions, custom errors, or other errors not automatically captured. Manual reporting is suitable for the following scenarios:\n\n- Recording handled errors in business logic.\n- Attaching contextual information (such as user ID, page state) for troubleshooting.\n- Monitoring exceptions from third-party services or asynchronous operations.\n\n#### Example: Reporting Custom Errors\n\n```javascript\n// Report custom error with context\nconst error = new Error(\"Login failed\");\nwindow.FC_RUM.addError(error, {\n  pageStatus: \"beta\",\n  userId: \"12345\",\n  action: \"login_attempt\",\n});\n```\n\n#### Example: Reporting Network Errors\n\n```javascript\nfetch(\"https://api.example.com/data\").catch((error) => {\n  window.FC_RUM.addError(error, {\n    requestUrl: \"https://api.example.com/data\",\n    method: \"GET\",\n  });\n});\n```\n\n#### Example: Reporting Handled Exceptions\n\n```javascript\ntry {\n  // Business logic that might throw an exception\n  riskyOperation();\n} catch (error) {\n  window.FC_RUM.addError(error, {\n    operation: \"riskyOperation\",\n    timestamp: Date.now(),\n  });\n}\n```\n\n### React Error Boundary Integration\n\nFlashduty RUM supports capturing component rendering errors through React [error boundaries](https://legacy.reactjs.org/docs/error-boundaries.html) and reporting error information. You can call the `addError` API in `componentDidCatch`, attaching component stack information for debugging.\n\n#### Example: React Error Boundary\n\n```javascript\nclass ErrorBoundary extends React.Component {\n  componentDidCatch(error, info) {\n    const renderingError = new Error(error.message);\n    renderingError.name = \"ReactRenderingError\";\n    renderingError.stack = info.componentStack; // Component stack\n    renderingError.cause = error; // Original error\n\n    window.FC_RUM.addError(renderingError, {\n      component: this.props.componentName || \"Unknown\",\n      version: \"1.0.0\",\n    });\n  }\n\n  render() {\n    return this.props.children;\n  }\n}\n```\n\n#### Usage\n\n```javascript\n<ErrorBoundary componentName=\"UserProfile\">\n  <UserProfile />\n</ErrorBoundary>\n```\n\n### Error Data Structure\n\nEach error record contains the following properties to describe error details and context:\n\n| Property        | Type   | Description                                                                                 |\n| --------------- | ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| `error.source`  | string | Error source (such as `console`, `network`, `custom`, `source`, `report`).                 |\n| `error.type`    | string | Error type or error code (such as `TypeError`, `NetworkError`).                            |\n| `error.message` | string | Concise, highly readable error message.                                                     |\n| `error.stack`   | string | Error stack trace or supplementary information.                                             |\n| `error.causes`  | Array  | List of associated errors providing additional context (optional).                          |\n| `context`       | Object | Custom contextual information (such as page state, user ID), passed through `addError`.    |\n\n### Error Filtering and Configuration\n\nTo ensure the accuracy and relevance of error data, Flashduty RUM applies the following filtering rules:\n\n- **Default filtering**:\n  - Only process errors with `source` as `custom`, `source`, `report`, or `console`.\n  - Ignore irrelevant errors from browser extensions, third-party scripts, or `network` sources.\n- **Stack requirement**: Errors must contain stack trace information, otherwise they may be ignored.\n- **Custom filtering**:\n  - Use the `beforeSend` callback to customize error handling logic, filter or modify error data.\n\n#### Example: Custom Error Filtering\n\n```javascript\nwindow.FC_RUM.init({\n  beforeSend: (event) => {\n    if (event.type === \"error\") {\n      // Ignore specific error messages\n      if (event.error.message.includes(\"ThirdPartyScript\")) {\n        return false; // Discard this error\n      }\n      // Add global context\n      event.context = { ...event.context, appVersion: \"2.1.0\" };\n    }\n    return true;\n  },\n});\n```\n\n## FAQ and Best Practices\n\n### FAQ\n\n1. **Why are some errors not aggregated?**\n\n   - Confirm whether the stack trace is complete, or if custom fingerprints conflict.\n   - Check if `sourcemap` is correctly uploaded; if not, the stack may not be properly resolved.\n\n2. **How to reduce noise from third-party script errors?**\n\n   - Use the `beforeSend` callback to filter specific error sources or messages.\n   - Example:\n     ```javascript\n     beforeSend: (event) => {\n       if (event.error.source === \"network\") return false;\n       return true;\n     };\n     ```\n\n3. **What if custom grouping doesn't work?**\n\n   - Ensure the `fingerprint` property is correctly set and its value is a string.\n   - Check if the `beforeSend` callback is being correctly called.\n\n### Best Practices\n\n1. **Enrich contextual information**:\n\n   - Attach business-related context (such as user ID, operation type) in `addError` to facilitate problem localization.\n   - Example: `{ userId: \"12345\", action: \"submit_form\" }`.\n\n2. **Optimize error boundaries**:\n\n   - Configure error boundaries for critical React components to ensure rendering errors are captured.\n   - Record component names and versions to track issues.\n\n3. **Control error volume**:\n\n   - Use sampling rates or `beforeSend` to filter low-value errors and avoid data overload.\n   - Prioritize monitoring critical errors that impact user experience.\n\n4. **Analysis and visualization**:\n\n   - View error data trends and distribution in the \"Analysis Dashboard\" - \"Error Analysis\" tab.\n   - View error rankings under different error categories in the dashboard to resolve key exception issues.\n\n## Next Steps\n\n- [View Errors](https://docs.flashcat.cloud/en/flashduty/rum/error-tracking-explorer?nav=01JCQ7A4N4WRWNXW8EWEHXCMF5) ",

Flashduty supports four issue statuses:\n\n- **For Review (for_review)**: New or recurring issues that need attention.\n- **In Progress (reviewed)**: Issues that have been classified and need to be fixed, either immediately or later.\n- **Ignored (ignored)**: Issues that don't require further investigation or handling.\n- **Resolved (resolved)**: Issues that have been fixed and no longer occur.\n\nAll newly discovered issues have an initial status of **For Review (for_review)**. Flashduty automatically updates statuses based on specific conditions, and you can also manually adjust issue statuses.\n\n## Automatic Issue Resolution\n\nFlashduty automatically marks inactive or resolved issues as **Resolved (resolved)** based on the following rules:\n\n- If the last reported version of an issue is more than 14 days old and the error hasn't appeared in newer versions, the system will automatically resolve it. To ensure automatic resolution works correctly, please configure version tags for your services.\n- If no `version` tag is set, the system will automatically resolve an issue when it hasn't had any new error reports in the past 14 days.\n\n:::tip\nProperly configuring your application's `version` tag is crucial for accurately identifying resolved issues.\n:::\n\n## Automatic Issue Reopening\n\nFlashduty has issue detection capability. When a previously resolved issue appears again, the system automatically reopens it and marks it as **For Review (for_review)**, while recording the event as \"Regression\" in the activity timeline.\n\n### What is Regression?\n\nRegression refers to previously fixed issues unexpectedly reappearing after code updates. Flashduty's regression detection automatically identifies these situations, reopening the relevant issues rather than creating duplicate issues, thereby preserving the complete context and history of the problem.\n\n### Regression Detection Mechanism\n\nRegression detection is triggered when either of the following conditions is met:\n\n- If a **Resolved (resolved)** error reappears in an updated version of the code, the system triggers regression detection\n- If a **Resolved (resolved)** error reappears when no version tag has been set\n\nOnce regression is detected, Flashduty will:\n\n1. Automatically change the issue status to **For Review (for_review)**\n2. Add a **Regression** label to the issue for easy identification\n\n### Regression Version Association\n\nRegression detection considers the service version information where the error occurred, triggering detection only in new versions after the issue was marked as **Resolved (resolved)**. To ensure this feature works correctly, be sure to configure a `version` tag for your service.\n\n```javascript\nwindow.FLASHCAT_RUM.init({\n  applicationId: \"rum-application-id\",\n  environment: \"production\",\n  version: \"1.0.0\", // Make sure to set the correct version number\n});\n```\n\n:::tip\nIf you don't set a version tag, the system will still mark recurring resolved issues as \"Regression\", but it cannot determine if they occurred in a new version.\n:::\n\n## Manually Updating Issue Status\n\nYou can manually update an issue's status anywhere issues are displayed, including issue lists or detail panels. Simply click on the current status and select a new status from the dropdown menu.\n\n<img src=\"https://docs-cdn.flashcat.cloud/images/png/a57c54a6a28915dec4480a9db9411e30.png\" alt=\"drawing\" style=\"display: block; margin: 0 auto;\" width=\"600\"/>\n\n## Status Management Best Practices\n\n- **Continuous Monitoring**: Regularly check issues with **For Review (for_review)** status to ensure new and recurring problems are addressed promptly.\n- **Version Management**: Always configure correct version tags for your applications so the system can accurately identify resolved issues.\n\nBy effectively managing issue statuses, your team can focus on solving important problems, reduce time spent handling noise, and improve overall development efficiency.\n\n## Next Steps\n\n- [Error Viewing](https://docs.flashcat.cloud/en/flashduty/rum/error-tracking-explorer?nav=01JCQ7A4N4WRWNXW8EWEHXCMF5) ",

You can choose to deliver alerts to multiple collaboration spaces. Alert notification rules follow the dispatch strategy under the collaboration space. You can set up on-call personnel for your team, so alerts will be assigned to the person on duty when they occur.\n\n![2025-08-20-10-16-14](https://docs-cdn.flashcat.cloud/images/png/b6ad24809a2ee8f0b3c0b38988b46030.png)\n\n:::tip\nYou must activate the On-call service to enable Issue alerts. Note that the On-call service charges based on active users, but members without licenses can still receive alert notifications, as even the free version has basic notification capabilities.\n:::\n\n## When Alerts Trigger\n\n1. **New Issues**: When error events cause new Issues to appear, an alert event is triggered.\n2. **Issue Updates**: When error events continuously merge into an unclosed Issue (pending, in progress), and it's been more than 24 hours since the last alert event, a new alert event will be triggered.\n3. **Issue Reopening**: When new errors are merged into a closed Issue, causing it to reopen, i.e., a regression.\n\nIssues trigger alert events that are delivered to collaboration spaces. Whether alert notifications are triggered depends on your integration settings, noise reduction configurations, and dispatch strategy configurations in the collaboration space. Please read the On-call service documentation for details.\n\nWhen an Issue is closed, the system triggers a closure-type alert event, and its associated incident may automatically recover.\n\n## Alert Severity\n\nThe severity of alert events triggered by Issues is currently automatically generated by the system. This choice balances configuration complexity and rationality, and may change in the future. The current system judgment rules are as follows:\n\n1. **Basic Judgment**:\n\n   - If an Issue has existed for more than 7 days, it is directly classified as \"Info\" level\n   - If it's a crash issue, it is directly classified as \"Critical\" level\n\n2. **Scoring System**: Severity is determined by accumulated scores, with final scores:\n\n   - ≥70 points: Critical\n   - ≥40 points: Warning\n   - <40 points: Info\n\n3. **Scoring Factors**:\n\n   - Environment impact: Production environment (50 points), Pre-production environment (30 points), Other environments (10 points)\n   - Error keywords: Contains critical keywords (+30 points) or warning keywords (+15 points)\n   - Suspected causes: API failure (+20 points), Code exception (+15 points), Unknown/Network error (+5 points)\n   - Problem duration: More than 24 hours (+20 points), More than 12 hours (+10 points) ",

Integrated into the RUM SDK, it can be enabled with simple configuration and supports flexible sampling strategies and privacy rule settings. Session replay provides powerful player and Devtools functionality, including operation timelines, error analysis, and context information viewing, helping developers efficiently troubleshoot issues and gain deep insights into user interaction details.\n\n## Session List\n\nIn the \"Session Replay\" menu, you can view recent session records, sorted by time in descending order by default. It supports sorting by fields such as session duration, view count, behavior count, error count, etc., and provides rich filtering conditions (such as time range, page, tags, etc.) for quickly locating target replay records.\n\nClick on any record item to open the player panel, divided into the following areas:\n\n- **Information Display Area**: Shows session context information such as access time, start and end pages, tags, etc.\n- **Playback Area**: Reproduces operation paths from the user's perspective, clearly displaying user interaction details.\n- **Playback Control Area**: Provides playback control functions for convenient operation.\n\n![Session Replay Panel](https://docs-cdn.flashcat.cloud/imges/png/e68c92a399e22e58ffdde318950e1c54.png)\n\n:::tip\nFor quick browsing, only replays with a duration **greater than 3 seconds** are displayed in the list\n:::\n\n## Player\n\nThe player supports functions such as play, pause, fast-forward, rewind, replay, speed control, fullscreen, and seek, and supports keyboard shortcuts to improve efficiency. During playback, the timeline will mark user behaviors (Action) and errors (Error) with different colored icons, making it easy to quickly overview key events in the session.\n![Player Interface](https://docs-cdn.flashcat.cloud/imges/png/c43b87b7764c5b0a136b0d721eb538cf.png)\n\nBy default, the player will automatically skip inactive segments to improve viewing efficiency. You can also disable this function through configuration to play completely according to the actual timeline.\n![Inactive Segment Configuration](https://docs-cdn.flashcat.cloud/imges/png/d85cc4b187530c8d27b9782ff545e26a.png)\n\n## Devtools\n\nThrough the \"View All Events and Errors\" function, you can enter wide-screen mode to view the session's operation timeline and detailed analysis. Devtools includes the following functions:\n\n- **Events Tab**: Displays all user operations in the session, supporting the following functions:\n\n  - Switch between relative time and absolute time display.\n  - Filter by event type (such as clicks, page navigation, etc.).\n  - Click on specific events, and the player will automatically jump to the corresponding timestamp.\n\n![Event Timeline](https://docs-cdn.flashcat.cloud/imges/png/e903b09dd88de3837e9c88959181dba9.png)\n\n- **Error Tab**: Lists all errors and issues in the session, supporting click-to-jump to detailed error information for quick identification and analysis.\n\n- **Attributes Tab**: Displays session context information (such as device, browser, geographic location, etc.), helping developers gain deep insights into problem background and perform precise identification.\n\n## Next Steps\n\n- [Learn About Privacy Protection Settings](https://docs.flashcat.cloud/zh/flashduty/rum/privacy-settings)\n",

By simply configuring sampling rates and privacy rules, you can quickly enable replay functionality.\n\n## Enable Collection\n\n### Automatic Collection\n\nThe replay SDK is already integrated into the RUM SDK. Configure the sampling rate to enable replay functionality.\n\n```js\nwindow.FC_RUM.init({\n  applicationId: \"YOUR_APPLICATION_ID\",\n  clientToken: \"YOUR_CLIENT_TOKEN\",\n  // ...\n  sessionReplaySampleRate: 10, // Default session replay sampling rate 10%\n  // ...\n});\n```\n\n::: tip\nSampling Method: When the client SDK initializes a session, it generates a random number between 0-1 and compares it with `rate/100`. If it falls within the range, that session will be collected as a sample, and replay data will be collected and reported within the session cycle.\n\nBased on sampled session, the session will be\nBased on the session being sampled, the session replay sampling rate (`sessionReplaySampleRate`) will be applied for a second round of calculation and sampling.\n:::\n\nBy default, after configuring the sampling rate, automatic collection will be enabled after `RUM.init()` is executed. If you want to manually control the collection timing (such as collecting data after user login), you can first enable the manual collection switch, then manually call the record method.\n\n```js\nwindow.FC_RUM.init({\n  applicationId: \"YOUR_APPLICATION_ID\",\n  clientToken: \"YOUR_CLIENT_TOKEN\",\n  // ...\n  sessionReplaySampleRate: 10, // 10% sampling rate\n  startSessionReplayRecordingManually: true, // Enable manual collection switch\n  // ...\n});\n\nif (userIsShouldRecord()) {\n  // If certain conditions are met, replay can be enabled\n  window.FC_RUM.startSessionReplayRecording(); // Enable data collection when called\n}\n```\n\nAfter enabling collection, you can stop collection using the `stopSessionReplayRecording()` method.\n\n### Force Enable\n\nIn certain scenarios, even if the sampling rate is not hit, you may still want to collect data for that session (such as monitoring newly launched features, or capturing subsequent operations after an exception), you can force enable replay by calling the `startSessionReplayRecording({ force: true })` method.\n\n::: warning\nNote: Force enable will only take effect when the current session is sampled but sessionReplay is not sampled. If the session itself is not sampled, even forcing replay enable will be ineffective.\n:::\n\n## Disable Collection\n\nIf you need to disable the collection functionality, adjust the corresponding replay sampling rate to 0 or simply remove the configuration item.\n\n```js\nwindow.FC_RUM.init({\n  applicationId: \"YOUR_APPLICATION_ID\",\n  clientToken: \"YOUR_CLIENT_TOKEN\",\n  // ...\n  sessionReplaySampleRate: 0, // Disable replay functionality\n  // ...\n});\n```\n\n## How It Works\n\nThe session replay SDK is implemented based on [rrweb](https://www.rrweb.io/).\n\nDuring the recording phase, the recording SDK takes snapshots of the current DOM and CSS styles, and collects corresponding events when user behaviors occur (DOM changes, mouse movements, clicks, form inputs, etc.). Data is reported after serialization, compression, and removal of sensitive information.\n\nDuring the replay phase, the playback SDK reconstructs the DOM based on snapshots and converts event behaviors to DOM changes for display at appropriate times.\n\nBefore data reporting, the SDK performs data compression in advance and executes this CPU-intensive operation in a web worker, which does not affect main thread rendering.\n\nThe SDK compatibility is consistent with the RUM SDK, supporting browsers above IE11.\n\n## Next Steps\n\n- [View Session Replays](https://docs.flashcat.cloud/zh/flashduty/rum/session-replay-explorer)\n- [Learn About Privacy Protection Settings](https://docs.flashcat.cloud/zh/flashduty/rum/privacy-settings)\n",

Behavior Recording and Replay\n\nQuickly recording user behavior and generating replays is the first step in analysis. During the recording phase, the recording SDK takes snapshots of the current DOM and CSS styles, and collects corresponding events when user behaviors occur (DOM changes, mouse movements, clicks, form inputs, etc.). Data is reported after serialization, compression, and removal of sensitive information.\n\n### 2. Problem Analysis and Optimization\n\nFlashduty RUM provides rich behavior data and analysis tools to help identify problems and optimize experience:\n\n#### Core Behavior Data\n\n- **User Interactions**: Timeline of operations such as clicks, scrolling, input, navigation, etc.\n- **Page Performance**: Page loading times, resource loading failures, API call delays, etc.\n- **Error Context**: Page state, DOM structure, and user operations when errors occur.\n\n#### Context Information\n\n- **User Environment**: Browser, device, operating system, network conditions.\n- **Operation Path**: Complete operation sequence of users during the session.\n- **Page Snapshots**: Page DOM snapshots when errors occur.\n\nThrough Flashduty RUM's visual replay tools, you can quickly analyze the correlation between user behavior and problems:\n\n| Problem Type                | Typical Manifestation              | Possible Causes                             | Identification Method                 |\n| --------------------------- | ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |\n| **Slow Page Loading**       | Page white screen, loading timeout | Resource loading failure, network delay     | Check for resource loading exceptions |\n| **Function Failure**        | Button clicks unresponsive         | Code logic errors, event binding issues     | View specific behavior and exceptions |\n| **Form Submission Failure** | Data not saved, submission failure | API response errors, form validation issues | View error and exception details      |\n\n## Problem Analysis Tools\n\n#### 1. Session Replay Panel\n\nIn the player, you can view all user operations including clicks, scrolling, and inputs, supporting playback controls such as fast-forward, replay, and seek, helping developers intuitively reproduce problem scenarios and precisely analyze user behavior.\n\n#### 2. Event and Context Correlation\n\nSession replay supports correlation with various events (such as view loading, errors, user behavior), allowing detailed viewing of errors and attributes (context information such as device type, browser version, geographic location, etc.), facilitating root cause identification and in-depth analysis.\n\n## Next Steps\n\n- [SDK Configuration](https://docs.flashcat.cloud/en/flashduty/rum/session-replay-config)\n- [View Session Replay](https://docs.flashcat.cloud/en/flashduty/rum/session-replay-explorer)\n- [Privacy Protection Settings](https://docs.flashcat.cloud/en/flashduty/rum/privacy-settings)\n",

By configuring the `defaultPrivacyLevel` field, developers can control the sensitivity of data collection, supporting multiple modes from displaying all text (except passwords) to completely hiding page text, ensuring user data security and compliance.\n\n## Privacy Strategies\n\nThe session replay functionality provides flexible privacy protection configuration through the `defaultPrivacyLevel` field, ensuring both functionality and data security when collecting user operation data. Below are three main privacy level configurations and their effects:\n:::tip\nInput fields with type \"password\" are sensitive information and will not be collected in any scenario.\n:::\n\n### Hide All Page Text\n\nConfigure `defaultPrivacyLevel: \"mask-all\"` to completely hide all text content on the page, preserving only operation behaviors and page structure, suitable for scenarios with extremely high data privacy requirements.\n\n```js\nwindow.FC_RUM.init({\n  applicationId: \"YOUR_APPLICATION_ID\",\n  clientToken: \"YOUR_CLIENT_TOKEN\",\n  // ...\n  sessionReplaySampleRate: 10, // Default sampling rate 10%\n  defaultPrivacyLevel: \"mask\",\n  // ...\n});\n```\n\n![Hide All Page Text](https://docs-cdn.flashcat.cloud/imges/png/03afebc34026be5cb5ad683665163c12.png)\n\n### Hide Input Field Content\n\nConfigure `defaultPrivacyLevel: \"mask-user-input\"` to hide content in user input fields (such as text inputs, select boxes, etc.) while preserving other page text, suitable for scenarios requiring protection of user input privacy.\n\n```js\nwindow.FC_RUM.init({\n  applicationId: \"YOUR_APPLICATION_ID\",\n  clientToken: \"YOUR_CLIENT_TOKEN\",\n  // ...\n  sessionReplaySampleRate: 10, // Default sampling rate 10%\n  defaultPrivacyLevel: \"mask-user-input\",\n  // ...\n});\n```\n\n![Hide Input Field Content](https://docs-cdn.flashcat.cloud/imges/png/e2f36a765e0dcb5db8a3ba9c24c42d6a.png)\n\n### Display All Text (Except Passwords)\n\nConfigure `defaultPrivacyLevel: \"allow\"` to allow collection of all text content on the page except password fields, suitable for scenarios requiring complete user interaction details.\n\n```js\nwindow.FC_RUM.init({\n  applicationId: \"YOUR_APPLICATION_ID\",\n  clientToken: \"YOUR_CLIENT_TOKEN\",\n  // ...\n  sessionReplaySampleRate: 10, // Default sampling rate 10%\n  defaultPrivacyLevel: \"allow\",\n  // ...\n});\n```\n\n![Display All Text](https://docs-cdn.flashcat.cloud/imges/png/24db39145913b960a588e45ab088c224.png)\n",
